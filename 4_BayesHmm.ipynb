The variance of 0.5 helps the model converge more quickly — consider the case where we have a variance of 1 or 2. In this case, the likelihood of observing a 2 when we are in state 1 is actually quite high, as it is within a standard deviation of the true emission value. Applying the prior that we are likely to be tightly centered around the mean prevents our model from being too confused about the state that is generating our observations.\n",

    "The priors on our transition matrix are noninformative, using `T[i] ~ Dirichlet(ones(K)/K)`. The Dirichlet prior used in this way assumes that the state is likely to change to any other state with equal probability. As we'll see, this transition matrix prior will be overwritten as we observe data."

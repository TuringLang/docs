        "`vi` will automatically recognize the variational family through the type of `q_init`.\n",
        "Here is a detailed documentation for the constructor:\n",

        "```{julia}\n",
        "@doc(Variational.q_meanfield_gaussian)\n",
        "```\n",
        "As we can see, the precise initialization can be customized through the keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's run VI with the default setting:\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "n_iters = 1000\n",
        "q_avg, q_last, info, state = vi(m, q_init, n_iters; show_progress=false);\n",
        "```\n",
        "The default setting uses the `AdvancedVI.RepGradELBO` objective, which corresponds to a variant of what is known as *automatic differentiation VI*[^KTRGB2017] or *stochastic gradient VI*[^TL2014] or *black-box VI*[^RGB2014] with the reparameterization gradient[^KW2014][^RMW2014][^TL2014].\n",
        "The default optimizer we use is `AdvancedVI.DoWG`[^KMJ2023] combined with a proximal operator.\n",
        "(The use of proximal operators with VI on a location-scale family is discussed in detail by J. Domke[^D2020][^DGG2023] and others[^KOWMG2023].)\n",
        "We will take a deeper look into the returned values and the keyword arguments in the following subsections.\n",
        "First, here is the full documentation for `vi`:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## Values Returned by `vi`\n",
        "The main output of the algorithm is `q_avg`, the average of the parameters generated by the optimization algorithm.\n",
        "For computing `q_avg`, the default setting uses what is known as polynomial averaging[^SZ2013].\n",
        "Usually, `q_avg` will perform better than the last-iterate `q_last`.\n",
        "For instance, we can compare the ELBO of the two:\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "@info(\"Objective of q_avg and q_last\",\n",

        "```\n",
        "Since the ELBO is estimated by a small number of samples, it appears noisy.\n",
        "Furthermore, at each step, the ELBO is evaluated on `q_last`, not `q_avg`, which is the actual output that we care about.\n",
        "To obtain more accurate ELBO estimates evaluated on `q_avg`, we have to define a custom callback function.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Custom Callback Functions\n",
        "To inspect the progress of optimization in more detail, one can define a custom callback function.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's plot the result:\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "iters = 1:10:length(info_mf)\n",
        "elbo_mf = [i.elbo_avg for i in info_mf[iters]]\n",

        "```\n",
        "We can see that the ELBO values are less noisy and progress more smoothly due to averaging.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using Different Optimisers\n",
        "The default optimiser we use is a proximal variant of DoWG[^KMJ2023].\n",
        "For Gaussian variational families, this works well as a default option.\n",
        "Sometimes, the step size of `AdvancedVI.DoWG` could be too large, resulting in unstable behavior.\n",
        "(In this case, we recommend trying `AdvancedVI.DoG`[^IHC2023])\n",
        "Or, for whatever reason, it might be desirable to use a different optimiser.\n",
        "Our implementation supports any optimiser that implements the [Optimisers.jl](https://fluxml.ai/Optimisers.jl/stable/) interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, let's try using `Optimisers.Adam`[^KB2014], which is a popular choice.\n",
        "Since `AdvancedVI` does not implement a proximal operator for `Optimisers.Adam`, we must use the `AdvancedVI.ClipScale()` projection operator, which ensures that the scale matrix of the variational approximation is positive definite.\n",
        "(See the paper by J. Domke 2020[^D2020] for more detail about the use of a projection operator.)\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "using Optimisers\n",
        "\n",

        "Plots.plot!(iters, elbo_adam, xlabel=\"Iterations\", ylabel=\"ELBO\", label=\"Adam\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "Compared to the default option `AdvancedVI.DoWG()`, we can see that `Optimisers.Adam(3e-3)` is converging more slowly.\n",
        "With more step size tuning, it is possible that `Optimisers.Adam` could perform better or equal.\n",
        "That is, most common optimisers require some degree of tuning to perform better or comparably to `AdvancedVI.DoWG()` or `AdvancedVI.DoG()`, which do not require much tuning at all.\n",
        "Due to this fact, they are referred to as parameter-free optimizers.\n",

        "## Using Full-Rank Variational Families\n",
        "So far, we have only used the mean-field Gaussian family.\n",
        "This, however, approximates the posterior covariance with a diagonal matrix.\n",
        "To model the full covariance matrix, we can use the *full-rank* Gaussian family[^TL2014][^KTRGB2017]:\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "q_init_fr = q_fullrank_gaussian(m);\n",

        "\n",
        "The term *full-rank* might seem a bit peculiar since covariance matrices are always full-rank.\n",
        "This term, however, traditionally comes from the fact that full-rank families use full-rank factors in addition to the diagonal of the covariance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast to the mean-field family, the full-rank family will often result in more computation per optimization step and slower convergence, especially in high dimensions:\n",

        "```\n",
        "However, we can see that the full-rank families achieve a higher ELBO in the end.\n",
        "Due to the relationship between the ELBO and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, this indicates that the full-rank covariance is much more accurate.\n",
        "This trade-off between statistical accuracy and optimization speed is often referred to as the *statistical-computational trade-off*.\n",
        "The fact that we can control this trade-off through the choice of variational family is a strength, rather than a limitation, of variational inference.\n",

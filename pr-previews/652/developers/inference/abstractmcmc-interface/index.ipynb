        "\n",
        "Turing implements a sampling interface (hosted at [AbstractMCMC](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl)) that is intended to provide a common framework for Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. The interface presents several structures and functions that one needs to overload in order to implement an interface-compatible sampler.\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide will demonstrate how to implement the interface without Turing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Interface overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Any implementation of an inference method that uses the AbstractMCMC interface should implement a subset of the following types and functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A subtype of `AbstractSampler`, defined as a mutable struct containing state information or sampler parameters.\n",
        "2. A function `sample_init!` which performs any necessary set-up (default: do not perform any set-up).\n",
        "3. A function `step!` which returns a transition that represents a single draw from the sampler.\n",
        "4. A function `transitions_init` which returns a container for the transitions obtained from the sampler (default: return a `Vector{T}` of length `N` where `T` is the type of the transition obtained in the first step and `N` is the number of requested samples).\n",
        "5. A function `transitions_save!` which saves transitions to the container (default: save the transition of iteration `i` at position `i` in the vector of transitions).\n",
        "6. A function `sample_end!` which handles any sampler wrap-up (default: do not perform any wrap-up).\n",
        "7. A function `bundle_samples` which accepts the container of transitions and returns a collection of samples (default: return the vector of transitions).\n",
        "\n",
        "The interface methods with exclamation points are those that are intended to allow for state mutation. Any mutating function is meant to allow mutation where needed -- you might use:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `sample_init!` to run some kind of sampler preparation, before sampling begins. This could mutate a sampler's state.\n",
        "- `step!` might mutate a sampler flag after each sample.\n",
        "- `sample_end!` contains any wrap-up you might need to do. If you were sampling in a transformed space, this might be where you convert everything back to a constrained space.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why do you have an interface?\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation for the interface is to allow Julia's fantastic probabilistic programming language community to have a set of standards and common implementations so we can all thrive together. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods tend to have a very similar framework to one another, and so a common interface should help more great inference methods built in single-purpose packages to experience more use among the community.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementing Metropolis-Hastings without Turing\n",
        "\n",
        "[Metropolis-Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) is often the first sampling method that people are exposed to. It is a very straightforward algorithm and is accordingly the easiest to implement, so it makes for a good example. In this section, you will learn how to use the types and functions listed above to implement the Metropolis-Hastings sampler using the MCMC interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "The full code for this implementation is housed in [AdvancedMH.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedMH.jl).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Imports\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's begin by importing the relevant libraries. We'll import `AbstractMCMC`, which contains the interface framework we'll fill out. We also need `Distributions` and `Random`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "# Import the relevant libraries.\n",
        "using AbstractMCMC: AbstractMCMC\n",

        "using Random\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "An interface extension (like the one we're writing right now) typically requires that you overload or implement several functions. Specifically, you should `import` the functions you intend to overload. This next code block accomplishes that.\n",
        "\n",
        "From `Distributions`, we need `Sampleable`, `VariateForm`, and `ValueSupport`, three abstract types that define a distribution. Models in the interface are assumed to be subtypes of `Sampleable{VariateForm, ValueSupport}`. In this section our model is going be be extremely simple, so we will not end up using these except to make sure that the inference functions are dispatching correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sampler\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's begin our sampler definition by defining a sampler called `MetropolisHastings` which is a subtype of `AbstractSampler`. Correct typing is very important for proper interface implementation -- if you are missing a subtype, your method may not be dispatched to when you call `sample`.\n",

        "\n",
        "Above, we have defined a sampler that stores the initial parameterization of the prior, and a distribution object from which proposals are drawn. You can have a struct that has no fields, and simply use it for dispatching onto the relevant functions, or you can store a large amount of state information in your sampler.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general intuition for what to store in your sampler struct is that anything you may need to perform inference between samples but you don't want to store in a transition should go into the sampler struct. It's the only way you can carry non-sample related state information between `step!` calls.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Next, we need to have a model of some kind. A model is a struct that's a subtype of `AbstractModel` that contains whatever information is necessary to perform inference on your problem. In our case we want to know the mean and variance parameters for a standard Normal distribution, so we can keep our model to the log density of a Normal.\n",
        "\n",

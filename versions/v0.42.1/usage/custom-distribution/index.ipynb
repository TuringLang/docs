To do this, we need to define the corresponding `Bijector` from `Bijectors.jl`, which is what `Turing.jl` uses internally to deal with constrained distributions.\n\nTo transform from [0, 1] to ℝ we can use the `Logit` bijector:",

For discrete distributions, there is no need to define a bijector; the `Identity` bijector is used by default.\n\nAs an alternative to the above, for `UnivariateDistribution` we could define the `minimum` and `maximum` of the distribution:",

We want to find values of these four coefficients to predict any given `y`.\n\nIntuitively, we can think of the coefficients as:\n\n  - `b1` is the coefficient which represents the effect of taking alcohol on the number of sneezes;\n  - `b2` is the coefficient which represents the effect of taking in no medicines on the number of sneezes;\n  - `b3` is the coefficient which represents the effect of interaction between taking alcohol and no medicine on the number of sneezes;\n\nThe `for` block creates a variable `theta` which is the weighted combination of the input features. We have defined the priors on these weights above. We then observe the likelihood of calculating `theta` given the actual label, `y[i]`."

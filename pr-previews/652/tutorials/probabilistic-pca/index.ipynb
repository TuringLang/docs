      "source": "## Overview of PCA\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental technique to analyse and visualise data.\nIt is an unsupervised learning method mainly used for dimensionality reduction.\n\nFor example, we have a data matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D}$, and we would like to extract $k \\ll D$ principal components which captures most of the information from the original matrix.\nThe goal is to understand $\\mathbf{X}$ through a lower dimensional subspace (e.g. two-dimensional subspace for visualisation convenience) spanned by the principal components.\n\nIn order to project the original data matrix into low dimensions, we need to find the principal directions where most of the variations of $\\mathbf{X}$ lie in.\nTraditionally, this is implemented via [singular value decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) which provides a robust and accurate computational framework for decomposing matrix into products of rotation-scaling-rotation matrices, particularly for large datasets(see an illustration [here](https://intoli.com/blog/pca-and-svd/)):\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}_{N \\times D} =  \\mathbf{U}_{N \\times r} \\times \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{r \\times r}  \\times  \\mathbf{V}^T_{r \\times D}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Sigma_{r \\times r}$ contains only $r := \\operatorname{rank} \\mathbf{X} \\leq \\min\\{N,D\\}$ non-zero singular values of $\\mathbf{X}$.\nIf we pad $\\Sigma$ with zeros and add arbitrary orthonormal columns to $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$, we obtain the more compact form:[^1]\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}_{N \\times D} = \\mathbf{U}_{N \\times N} \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{N \\times D} \\mathbf{V}_{D \\times D}^T\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$ are unitary matrices (i.e. with orthonormal columns).\nSuch a decomposition always exists for any matrix.\nColumns of $\\mathbf{V}$ are the principal directions/axes.\nThe percentage of variations explained can be calculated using the ratios of singular values.[^3]\n\nHere we take a probabilistic perspective.\nFor more details and a mathematical derivation, we recommend Bishop's textbook (Christopher M. Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, 2006).\nThe idea of proabilistic PCA is to find a latent variable $z$ that can be used to describe the hidden structure in a dataset.[^2]\nConsider a data set $\\mathbf{X}_{D \\times N}=\\{x_i\\}$ with $i=1,2,...,N$ data points, where each data point $x_i$ is $D$-dimensional (i.e. $x_i \\in \\mathcal{R}^D$).\nNote that, here we use the flipped version of the data matrix. We aim to represent the original $n$ dimensional vector using a lower dimensional a latent variable $z_i \\in \\mathcal{R}^k$.\n\nWe first assume that each latent variable $z_i$ is normally distributed:\n\n$$\nz_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)\n$$\n\nand the corresponding data point is generated via projection:\n\n$$\nx_i | z_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{W} z_i + \\boldsymbol{μ}, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})\n$$\n\nwhere the projection matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{D \\times k}$ accommodates the principal axes.\nThe above formula expresses $x_i$ as a linear combination of the basis columns in the projection matrix `W`, where the combination coefficients sit in `z_i` (they are the coordinats of `x_i` in the new $k$-dimensional space.).\nWe can also express the above formula in matrix form: $\\mathbf{X}_{D \\times N} \\approx \\mathbf{W}_{D \\times k} \\mathbf{Z}_{k \\times N}$.\nWe are interested in inferring $\\mathbf{W}$, $μ$ and $\\sigma$.\n\nClassical PCA is the specific case of probabilistic PCA when the covariance of the noise becomes infinitesimally small, i.e. $\\sigma^2 \\to 0$.\nProbabilistic PCA generalizes classical PCA, this can be seen by marginalizing out the the latent variable.[^2]\n\n## The gene expression example\n\nIn the first example, we illustrate:\n\n  - how to specify the probabilistic model and\n  - how to perform inference on $\\mathbf{W}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and $\\sigma$ using MCMC.\n\nWe use simulated gemnome data to demonstrate these.\nThe simulation is inspired by biological measurement of expression of genes in cells, and each cell is characterized by different gene features.\nWhile the human genome is (mostly) identical between all the cells in the body, there exist interesting differences in gene expression in different human tissues and disease conditions.\nOne way to investigate certain diseases is to look at differences in gene expression in cells from patients and healthy controls (usually from the same tissue).\n\nUsually, we can assume that the changes in gene expression only affect a subset of all genes (and these can be linked to diseases in some way).\nOne of the challenges for this kind of data is to explore the underlying structure, e.g. to make the connection between a certain state (healthy/disease) and gene expression.\nThis becomes difficult when the dimensions is very large (up to 20000 genes across 1000s of cells). So in order to find structure in this data, it is useful to project the data into a lower dimensional space.\n\nRegardless of the biological background, the more abstract problem formulation is to project the data living in high-dimensional space onto a representation in lower-dimensional space where most of the variation is concentrated in the first few dimensions.\nWe use PCA to explore underlying structure or pattern which may not necessarily be obvious from looking at the raw data itself.\n\n#### Step 1: configuration of dependencies\n\nFirst, we load the dependencies used."

The prior is determined by a precision hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Here, smaller values of $\\alpha$ correspond to more important components.\nYou can find more details about this in, for example, Bishop (2006) [^5]."

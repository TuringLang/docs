        "However, each random variable in the model will have its own distribution, and often some of these will be constrained.\n",
        "For example, if `b ~ LogNormal()` is a random variable in a model, then $p(b)$ will be zero for any $b \\leq 0$.\n",
        "Consequently, any joint probability $p(b, c, \\ldots)$ will also be zero for any combination of parameters where $b \\leq 0$, and so that joint distribution is itself constrained.\n",

        "Note that `vi_linked[vn_x]` can also be used as shorthand for `getindex(vi_linked, vn_x)`; this usage is common in the DynamicPPL/Turing codebase.\n",
        ":::\n",
        "\n",
        "We can see (for this linked varinfo) that there are _two_ differences between these outputs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. _The internal representation has been transformed using the bijector (in this case, the log function)._\n",
        "   This means that the `istrans()` flag which we used above doesn't modify the model representation: it only tells us whether the internal representation has been transformed or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. _The internal representation is a vector, whereas the model representation is a scalar._\n",
        "   This is because in DynamicPPL, _all_ internal values are vectorised (i.e. converted into some vector), regardless of distribution. On the other hand, since the model specifies a univariate distribution, the model representation is a scalar.\n",
        "\n",
        "One might also ask, what is the internal representation for an _unlinked_ varinfo?\n",

        "\n",
        "While DynamicPPL provides the _functionality_ for transforming variables, the transformation itself happens at an even higher level, i.e. in the sampler itself.\n",
        "The HMC sampler in Turing.jl is in [this file](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/blob/5b24cebe773922e0f3d5c4cb7f53162eb758b04d/src/mcmc/hmc.jl).\n",

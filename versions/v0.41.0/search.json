    "text": "Turing.jl v0.41 brings with it all the underlying changes in DynamicPPL 0.38. Please see the DynamicPPL changelog for full details: in this section we only describe the changes that will directly affect end-users of Turing.jl.\n\n\nA number of functions such as returned and predict will have substantially better performance in this release.\n\n\n\nDistributions.ProductNamedTupleDistribution can now be used on the right-hand side of ~ in Turing models.\n\n\n\nInitial parameters for MCMC sampling must now be specified in a different form. You still need to use the initial_params keyword argument to sample, but the allowed values are different. For almost all samplers in Turing.jl (except Emcee) this should now be a DynamicPPL.AbstractInitStrategy.\nThere are three kinds of initialisation strategies provided out of the box with Turing.jl (they are exported so you can use these directly with using Turing):\n\nInitFromPrior(): Sample from the prior distribution. This is the default for most samplers in Turing.jl (if you don’t specify initial_params).\nInitFromUniform(a, b): Sample uniformly from [a, b] in linked space. This is the default for Hamiltonian samplers. If a and b are not specified it defaults to [-2, 2], which preserves the behaviour in previous versions (and mimics that of Stan).\nInitFromParams(p): Explicitly provide a set of initial parameters. Note: p must be either a NamedTuple or an AbstractDict{&lt;:VarName}; it can no longer be a Vector. Parameters must be provided in unlinked space, even if the sampler later performs linking.\n\nFor this release of Turing.jl, you can also provide a NamedTuple or AbstractDict{&lt;:VarName} and this will be automatically wrapped in InitFromParams for you. This is an intermediate measure for backwards compatibility, and will eventually be removed.\n\n\nThis change is made because Vectors are semantically ambiguous. It is not clear which element of the vector corresponds to which variable in the model, nor is it clear whether the parameters are in linked or unlinked space. Previously, both of these would depend on the internal structure of the VarInfo, which is an implementation detail. In contrast, the behaviour of AbstractDicts and NamedTuples is invariant to the ordering of variables and it is also easier for readers to understand which variable is being set to which value.\nIf you were previously using varinfo[:] to extract a vector of initial parameters, you can now use Dict(k =&gt; varinfo[k] for k in keys(varinfo) to extract a Dict of initial parameters.\nFor more details about initialisation you can also refer to the main TuringLang docs, and/or the DynamicPPL API docs.\n\n\n\nThe resume_from keyword argument to sample is now removed. Instead of sample(...; resume_from=chain) you can use sample(...; initial_state=loadstate(chain)) which is entirely equivalent. loadstate is exported from Turing now instead of in DynamicPPL.\nNote that loadstate only works for MCMCChains.Chains. For FlexiChains users please consult the FlexiChains docs directly where this functionality is described in detail.\n\n\n\npointwise_logdensities(model, chn), pointwise_loglikelihoods(...), and pointwise_prior_logdensities(...) now return an MCMCChains.Chains object if chn is itself an MCMCChains.Chains object. The old behaviour of returning an OrderedDict is still available: you just need to pass OrderedDict as the third argument, i.e., pointwise_logdensities(model, chn, OrderedDict).\n\n\n\n\nHMC and NUTS samplers no longer take an extra single step before starting the chain. This means that if you do not discard any samples at the start, the first sample will be the initial parameters (which may be user-provided).\nNote that if the initial sample is included, the corresponding sampler statistics will be missing. Due to a technical limitation of MCMCChains.jl, this causes all indexing into MCMCChains to return Union{Float64, Missing} or similar. If you want the old behaviour, you can discard the first sample (e.g. using discard_initial=1)."

    "text": "Breaking changes\nDynamicPPL 0.37\nTuring.jl v0.40 updates DynamicPPL compatibility to 0.37. The summary of the changes provided here is intended for end-users of Turing. If you are a package developer, or would otherwise like to understand these changes in-depth, please see the DynamicPPL changelog.\n\n@submodel is now completely removed; please use to_submodel.\nPrior and likelihood calculations are now completely separated in Turing. Previously, the log-density used to be accumulated in a single field and thus there was no clear way to separate prior and likelihood components.\n\n@addlogprob! f, where f is a float, now adds to the likelihood by default.\nYou can instead use @addlogprob! (; logprior=x, loglikelihood=y) to control which log-density component to add to.\nThis means that usage of PriorContext and LikelihoodContext is no longer needed, and these have now been removed.\n\nThe special __context__ variable has been removed. If you still need to access the evaluation context, it is now available as __model__.context.\n\nLog-density in chains\nWhen sampling from a Turing model, the resulting MCMCChains.Chains object now contains not only the log-joint (accessible via chain[:lp]) but also the log-prior and log-likelihood (chain[:logprior] and chain[:loglikelihood] respectively).\nThese values now correspond to the log density of the sampled variables exactly as per the model definition / user parameterisation and thus will ignore any linking (transformation to unconstrained space). For example, if the model is @model f() = x ~ LogNormal(), chain[:lp] would always contain the value of logpdf(LogNormal(), x) for each sampled value of x. Previously these values could be incorrect if linking had occurred: some samplers would return logpdf(Normal(), log(x)) i.e. the log-density with respect to the transformed distribution.\nGibbs sampler\nWhen using Turing’s Gibbs sampler, e.g. Gibbs(:x =&gt; MH(), :y =&gt; HMC(0.1, 20)), the conditioned variables (for example y during the MH step, or x during the HMC step) are treated as true observations. Thus the log-density associated with them is added to the likelihood. Previously these would effectively be added to the prior (in the sense that if LikelihoodContext was used they would be ignored). This is unlikely to affect users but we mention it here to be explicit. This change only affects the log probabilities as the Gibbs component samplers see them; the resulting chain will include the usual log prior, likelihood, and joint, as described above.\nParticle Gibbs\nPreviously, only ‘true’ observations (i.e., x ~ dist where x is a model argument or conditioned upon) would trigger resampling of particles. Specifically, there were two cases where resampling would not be triggered:\n\nCalls to @addlogprob!\nGibbs-conditioned variables: e.g. y in Gibbs(:x =&gt; PG(20), :y =&gt; MH())\n\nTuring 0.40 changes this such that both of the above cause resampling. (The second case follows from the changes to the Gibbs sampler, see above.)\nThis release also fixes a bug where, if the model ended with one of these statements, their contribution to the particle weight would be ignored, leading to incorrect results.\nThe changes above also mean that certain models that previously worked with PG-within-Gibbs may now error. Specifically this is likely to happen when the dimension of the model is variable. For example:\n@model function f()\n    x ~ Bernoulli()\n    if x\n        y1 ~ Normal()\n    else\n        y1 ~ Normal()\n        y2 ~ Normal()\n    end\n    # (some likelihood term...)\nend\nsample(f(), Gibbs(:x =&gt; PG(20), (:y1, :y2) =&gt; MH()), 100)\nThis sampler now cannot be used for this model because depending on which branch is taken, the number of observations will be different. To use PG-within-Gibbs, the number of observations that the PG component sampler sees must be constant. Thus, for example, this will still work if x, y1, and y2 are grouped together under the PG component sampler.\nIf you absolutely require the old behaviour, we recommend using Turing.jl v0.39, but also thinking very carefully about what the expected behaviour of the model is, and checking that Turing is sampling from it correctly (note that the behaviour on v0.39 may in general be incorrect because of the fact that Gibbs-conditioned variables did not trigger resampling). We would also welcome any GitHub issues highlighting such problems. Our support for dynamic models is incomplete and is liable to undergo further changes."

If t isa Turing.Inference.Transition, t.stat is always a NamedTuple, not nothing (if it genuinely has no information then it’s an empty NamedTuple). Furthermore, t.lp has now been split up into t.logprior and t.loglikelihood (see also ‘Log-density in chains’ section above)."

Variables in submodels are now represented correctly with field accessors. For example:\nusing Turing\n@model inner() = x ~ Normal()\n@model outer() = a ~ to_submodel(inner())\nkeys(VarInfo(outer())) now returns [@varname(a.x)] instead of [@varname(var\"a.x\")]\nFurthermore, you can now either condition on the outer model like outer() | (@varname(a.x) =&gt; 1.0), or the inner model like inner() | (@varname(x) =&gt; 1.0). If you use the conditioned inner model as a submodel, the conditioning will still apply correctly.\nPlease see the DynamicPPL release notes for fuller details."

You can continue to use Zygote by importing AutoZygote from ADTypes and it may well continue to work, but it is no longer tested and no effort will be expended to fix it if something breaks.\nMooncake is the recommended replacement for Zygote.\n\n\nDynamicPPL 0.35\nTuring.jl v0.37 uses DynamicPPL v0.35, which brings with it several breaking changes:\n\nThe right hand side of .~ must from now on be a univariate distribution.\nIndexing VarInfo objects by samplers has been removed completely.\nThe order in which nested submodel prefixes are applied has been reversed.\nThe arguments for the constructor of LogDensityFunction have changed. LogDensityFunction also now satisfies the LogDensityProblems interface, without needing a wrapper object.\n\nFor more details about all of the above, see the changelog of DynamicPPL here.\n\n\nExport list\nTuring.jl’s export list has been cleaned up a fair bit. This affects what is imported into your namespace when you do an unqualified using Turing. You may need to import things more explicitly than before.\n\nThe DynamicPPL and AbstractMCMC modules are no longer exported. You will need to import DynamicPPL or using DynamicPPL: DynamicPPL (likewise AbstractMCMC) yourself, which in turn means that they have to be made available in your project environment.\n@logprob_str and @prob_str have been removed following a long deprecation period.\nWe no longer re-export everything from Bijectors and Libtask. To get around this, add using Bijectors or using Libtask at the top of your script (but we recommend using more selective imports).\n\nWe no longer export Bijectors.ordered. If you were using ordered, even Bijectors does not (currently) export this. You will have to manually import it with using Bijectors: ordered.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we have added a few more exports:\n\nDynamicPPL.returned and DynamicPPL.prefix are exported (for use with submodels).\nLinearAlgebra.I is exported for convenience."

    "text": "Breaking changes\n0.36.0 introduces a new Gibbs sampler. It’s been included in several previous releases as Turing.Experimental.Gibbs, but now takes over the old Gibbs sampler, which gets removed completely.\nThe new Gibbs sampler currently supports the same user-facing interface as the old one, but the old constructors have been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. Also, given that the internals have been completely rewritten in a very different manner, there may be accidental breakage that we haven’t anticipated. Please report any you find.\nGibbsConditional has also been removed. It was never very user-facing, but it was exported, so technically this is breaking.\nThe old Gibbs constructor relied on being called with several subsamplers, and each of the constructors of the subsamplers would take as arguments the symbols for the variables that they are to sample, e.g. Gibbs(HMC(:x), MH(:y)). This constructor has been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. The new constructor works by mapping symbols, VarNames, or iterables thereof to samplers, e.g. Gibbs(x=&gt;HMC(), y=&gt;MH()), Gibbs(@varname(x) =&gt; HMC(), @varname(y) =&gt; MH()), Gibbs((:x, :y) =&gt; NUTS(), :z =&gt; MH()). This allows more granular specification of which sampler to use for which variable.\nLikewise, the old constructor for calling one subsampler more often than another, Gibbs((HMC(0.01, 4, :x), 2), (MH(:y), 1)) has been deprecated. The new way to do this is to use RepeatSampler, also introduced at this version: Gibbs(@varname(x) =&gt; RepeatSampler(HMC(0.01, 4), 2), @varname(y) =&gt; MH())."

Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.\nWe specify the model in Turing:\n\nusing Turing\n\n@model function gaussian_mixture_model(x)\n    # Draw the parameters for each of the K=2 clusters from a standard normal distribution.\n    K = 2\n    μ ~ MvNormal(Zeros(K), I)\n\n    # Draw the weights for the K clusters from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters αₖ = 1.\n    w ~ Dirichlet(K, 1.0)\n    # Alternatively, one could use a fixed set of weights.\n    # w = fill(1/K, K)\n\n    # Construct categorical distribution of assignments.\n    distribution_assignments = Categorical(w)\n\n    # Construct multivariate normal distributions of each cluster.\n    D, N = size(x)\n    distribution_clusters = [MvNormal(Fill(μₖ, D), I) for μₖ in μ]\n\n    # Draw assignments for each datum and generate it from the multivariate normal distribution.\n    k = Vector{Int}(undef, N)\n    for i in 1:N\n        k[i] ~ distribution_assignments\n        x[:, i] ~ distribution_clusters[k[i]]\n    end\n\n    return k\nend\n\nmodel = gaussian_mixture_model(x);\n\nWe run a MCMC simulation to obtain an approximation of the posterior distribution of the parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(w\\) and assignments \\(k\\). We use a Gibbs sampler that combines a particle Gibbs sampler for the discrete parameters (assignments \\(k\\)) and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler for the continuous parameters (\\(\\mu\\) and \\(w\\)).

If you do not, the multiple chains will run sequentially, and you may notice a warning. For more information, see the Turing documentation on sampling multiple chains.",

However, these actually represent the same solution: it does not matter whether we assign \\(\\mu_1\\) to the first cluster and \\(\\mu_2\\) to the second, or vice versa, since the resulting sum is the same. (In principle it is also possible for the parameters to swap places within a single chain, although this does not happen in this example.) For more information see the Stan documentation, or Bishop’s book, where the concept of identifiability is discussed.\nHaving \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\mu_2\\) swap can complicate the interpretation of the results, especially when different chains converge to different assignments.

It turns out that the MixtureModel distribution it provides has, as its logpdf method, logpdf(MixtureModel([Component_Distributions], weight_vector), Y), where Y can be either a single observation or vector of observations.\nIn fact, Distributions.jl provides many convenient constructors for mixture models, allowing further simplification in common special cases.\nFor example, when mixtures distributions are of the same type, one can write: ~ MixtureModel(Normal, [(μ1, σ1), (μ2, σ2)], w), or when the weight vector is known to allocate probability equally, it can be ommited.\nThe logpdf implementation for a MixtureModel distribution is exactly the marginalization defined above, and so our model can be simplified to:\n\n@model function gmm_marginalized(x)\n    K = 2\n    D, _ = size(x)\n    μ ~ ordered(MvNormal(Zeros(K), I))\n    w ~ Dirichlet(K, 1.0)\n    x ~ MixtureModel([MvNormal(Fill(μₖ, D), I) for μₖ in μ], w)\nend\nmodel = gmm_marginalized(x);\n\nAs we have summed out the discrete components, we can perform inference using NUTS() alone.\n\nsampler = NUTS()\nchains = sample(model, sampler, MCMCThreads(), nsamples, nchains; discard_initial = burn);\n\nNUTS() significantly outperforms our compositional Gibbs sampler, in large part because our model is now Rao-Blackwellized thanks to the marginalization of our assignment parameter.\n\nplot(chains[[\"μ[1]\", \"μ[2]\"]], legend=true)",

    "title": "Bayesian Time Series Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In time series analysis we are often interested in understanding how various real-life circumstances impact our quantity of interest. These can be, for instance, season, day of week, or time of day. To analyse this it is useful to decompose time series into simpler components (corresponding to relevant circumstances) and infer their relevance. In this tutorial we are going to use Turing for time series analysis and learn about useful ways to decompose time series.\n\nModelling time series\nBefore we start coding, let us talk about what exactly we mean with time series decomposition. In a nutshell, it is a divide-and-conquer approach where we express a time series as a sum or a product of simpler series. For instance, the time series \\(f(t)\\) can be decomposed into a sum of \\(n\\) components\n\\[f(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(t),\\]\nor we can decompose \\(g(t)\\) into a product of \\(m\\) components\n\\[g(t) = \\prod_{i=1}^m g_i(t).\\]\nWe refer to this as additive or multiplicative decomposition respectively. This type of decomposition is great since it lets us reason about individual components, which makes encoding prior information and interpreting model predictions very easy. Two common components are trends, which represent the overall change of the time series (often assumed to be linear), and cyclic effects which contribute oscillating effects around the trend. Let us simulate some data with an additive linear trend and oscillating effects.\n\nusing Turing\nusing FillArrays\nusing StatsPlots\n\nusing LinearAlgebra\nusing Random\nusing Statistics\n\nRandom.seed!(12345)\n\ntrue_sin_freq = 2\ntrue_sin_amp = 5\ntrue_cos_freq = 7\ntrue_cos_amp = 2.5\ntmax = 10\nβ_true = 2\nα_true = -1\ntt = 0:0.05:tmax\nf₁(t) = α_true + β_true * t\nf₂(t) = true_sin_amp * sinpi(2 * t * true_sin_freq / tmax)\nf₃(t) = true_cos_amp * cospi(2 * t * true_cos_freq / tmax)\nf(t) = f₁(t) + f₂(t) + f₃(t)\n\nplot(f, tt; label=\"f(t)\", title=\"Observed time series\", legend=:topleft, linewidth=3)\nplot!(\n    [f₁, f₂, f₃],\n    tt;\n    label=[\"f₁(t)\" \"f₂(t)\" \"f₃(t)\"],\n    style=[:dot :dash :dashdot],\n    linewidth=1,\n)\n\n\n\n\nEven though we use simple components, combining them can give rise to fairly complex time series. In this time series, cyclic effects are just added on top of the trend. If we instead multiply the components the cyclic effects cause the series to oscillate between larger and larger values, since they get scaled by the trend.\n\ng(t) = f₁(t) * f₂(t) * f₃(t)\n\nplot(g, tt; label=\"f(t)\", title=\"Observed time series\", legend=:topleft, linewidth=3)\nplot!([f₁, f₂, f₃], tt; label=[\"f₁(t)\" \"f₂(t)\" \"f₃(t)\"], linewidth=1)\n\n\n\n\nUnlike \\(f\\), \\(g\\) oscillates around \\(0\\) since it is being multiplied with sines and cosines. To let a multiplicative decomposition oscillate around the trend we could define it as \\(\\tilde{g}(t) = f₁(t) * (1 + f₂(t)) * (1 + f₃(t)),\\) but for convenience we will leave it as is. The inference machinery is the same for both cases.\n\n\nModel fitting\nHaving discussed time series decomposition, let us fit a model to the time series above and recover the true parameters. Before building our model, we standardise the time axis to \\([0, 1]\\) and subtract the max of the time series. This helps convergence while maintaining interpretability and the correct scales for the cyclic components.\n\nσ_true = 0.35\nt = collect(tt[begin:3:end])\nt_min, t_max = extrema(t)\nx = (t .- t_min) ./ (t_max - t_min)\nyf = f.(t) .+ σ_true .* randn(size(t))\nyf_max = maximum(yf)\nyf = yf .- yf_max\n\nscatter(x, yf; title=\"Standardised data\", legend=false)\n\n\n\n\nLet us now build our model. We want to assume a linear trend, and cyclic effects. Encoding a linear trend is easy enough, but what about cyclical effects? We will take a scattergun approach, and create multiple cyclical features using both sine and cosine functions and let our inference machinery figure out which to keep. To do this, we define how long a one period should be, and create features in reference to said period. How long a period should be is problem dependent, but as an example let us say it is \\(1\\) year. If we then find evidence for a cyclic effect with a frequency of 2, that would mean a biannual effect. A frequency of 4 would mean quarterly etc. Since we are using synthetic data, we are simply going to let the period be 1, which is the entire length of the time series.\n\nfreqs = 1:10\nnum_freqs = length(freqs)\nperiod = 1\ncyclic_features = [sinpi.(2 .* freqs' .* x ./ period) cospi.(2 .* freqs' .* x ./ period)]\n\nplot_freqs = [1, 3, 5]\nfreq_ptl = plot(\n    cyclic_features[:, plot_freqs];\n    label=permutedims([\"sin(2π$(f)x)\" for f in plot_freqs]),\n    title=\"Cyclical features subset\",\n)\n\n\n\n\nHaving constructed the cyclical features, we can finally build our model. The model we will implement looks like this\n\\[\nf(t) = \\alpha + \\beta_t t + \\sum_{i=1}^F \\beta_{\\sin{},i} \\sin{}(2\\pi f_i t) + \\sum_{i=1}^F \\beta_{\\cos{},i} \\cos{}(2\\pi f_i t),\n\\]\nwith a Gaussian likelihood \\(y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(f(t), \\sigma^2)\\). For convenience we are treating the cyclical feature weights \\(\\beta_{\\sin{},i}\\) and \\(\\beta_{\\cos{},i}\\) the same in code and weight them with \\(\\beta_c\\). And just because it is so easy, we parameterise our model with the operation with which to apply the cyclic effects. This lets us use the exact same code for both additive and multiplicative models. Finally, we plot prior predictive samples to make sure our priors make sense.\n\n@model function decomp_model(t, c, op)\n    α ~ Normal(0, 10)\n    βt ~ Normal(0, 2)\n    βc ~ MvNormal(Zeros(size(c, 2)), I)\n    σ ~ truncated(Normal(0, 0.1); lower=0)\n\n    cyclic = c * βc\n    trend = α .+ βt .* t\n    μ = op(trend, cyclic)\n    y ~ MvNormal(μ, σ^2 * I)\n    return (; trend, cyclic)\nend\n\ny_prior_samples = mapreduce(hcat, 1:100) do _\n    rand(decomp_model(t, cyclic_features, +)).y\nend\nplot(t, y_prior_samples; linewidth=1, alpha=0.5, color=1, label=\"\", title=\"Prior samples\")\nscatter!(t, yf; color=2, label=\"Data\")\n\n\n\n\nWith the model specified and with a reasonable prior we can now let Turing decompose the time series for us!\n\nusing MCMCChains: get_sections\n\nfunction mean_ribbon(samples)\n    qs = quantile(samples)\n    low = qs[:, Symbol(\"2.5%\")]\n    up = qs[:, Symbol(\"97.5%\")]\n    m = mean(samples)[:, :mean]\n    return m, (m - low, up - m)\nend\n\nfunction get_decomposition(model, x, cyclic_features, chain, op)\n    chain_params = get_sections(chain, :parameters)\n    return returned(model(x, cyclic_features, op), chain_params)\nend\n\nfunction plot_fit(x, y, decomp, ymax)\n    trend = mapreduce(x -&gt; x.trend, hcat, decomp)\n    cyclic = mapreduce(x -&gt; x.cyclic, hcat, decomp)\n\n    trend_plt = plot(\n        x,\n        trend .+ ymax;\n        color=1,\n        label=nothing,\n        alpha=0.2,\n        title=\"Trend\",\n        xlabel=\"Time\",\n        ylabel=\"f₁(t)\",\n    )\n    ls = [ones(length(t)) t] \\ y\n    α̂, β̂ = ls[1], ls[2:end]\n    plot!(\n        trend_plt,\n        t,\n        α̂ .+ t .* β̂ .+ ymax;\n        label=\"Least squares trend\",\n        color=5,\n        linewidth=4,\n    )\n\n    scatter!(trend_plt, x, y .+ ymax; label=nothing, color=2, legend=:topleft)\n    cyclic_plt = plot(\n        x,\n        cyclic;\n        color=1,\n        label=nothing,\n        alpha=0.2,\n        title=\"Cyclic effect\",\n        xlabel=\"Time\",\n        ylabel=\"f₂(t)\",\n    )\n    return trend_plt, cyclic_plt\nend\n\nchain = sample(decomp_model(x, cyclic_features, +) | (; y=yf), NUTS(), 2000, progress=false)\nyf_samples = predict(decomp_model(x, cyclic_features, +), chain)\nm, conf = mean_ribbon(yf_samples)\npredictive_plt = plot(\n    t,\n    m .+ yf_max;\n    ribbon=conf,\n    label=\"Posterior density\",\n    title=\"Posterior decomposition\",\n    xlabel=\"Time\",\n    ylabel=\"f(t)\",\n)\nscatter!(predictive_plt, t, yf .+ yf_max; color=2, label=\"Data\", legend=:topleft)\n\ndecomp = get_decomposition(decomp_model, x, cyclic_features, chain, +)\ndecomposed_plt = plot_fit(t, yf, decomp, yf_max)\nplot(predictive_plt, decomposed_plt...; layout=(3, 1), size=(700, 1000))\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.0125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInference is successful and the posterior beautifully captures the data.

This post will focus on the usage of VI in Turing rather than the principles and theory underlying VI. If you are interested in understanding the mathematics you can checkout our write-up or any other resource online (there are a lot of great ones).\nLet’s start with a minimal example. Consider a Turing.Model, which we denote as model. Approximating the posterior associated with model via VI is as simple as\nm = model(data...)               # instantiate model on the data\nq_init = q_fullrank_gaussian(m)  # initial variational approximation\nvi(m, q_init, 1000) # perform VI with the default algorithm on `m` for 1000 iterations\nThus, it’s no more work than standard MCMC sampling in Turing. The default algorithm uses stochastic gradient descent to minimize the (exclusive) KL divergence. This is commonly referred to as automatic differentiation variational inference1, stochastic gradient VI2, and black-box variational inference3 with the reparameterization gradient456.\nTo get a bit more into what we can do with VI, let’s look at a more concrete example. We will reproduce the tutorial on Bayesian linear regression using VI instead of MCMC. After that, we will discuss how to customize the behavior of vi for more advanced usage.\nLet’s first import the relevant packages:\nusing Random\nusing Turing\nusing Turing: Variational\nusing AdvancedVI\nusing Plots\n\nRandom.seed!(42);",

The default optimizer we use is AdvancedVI.DoWG13 combined with a proximal operator. (The use of proximal operators with VI on a location-scale family is discussed in detail by J. Domke1415 and others16.) We will take a deeper look into the returned values and the keyword arguments in the following subsections.

For computing q_avg, the default setting uses what is known as polynomial averaging17. Usually, q_avg will perform better than the last-iterate q_last. For instance, we can compare the ELBO of the two:\n\n@info(\"Objective of q_avg and q_last\",\n    ELBO_q_avg = estimate_objective(AdvancedVI.RepGradELBO(32), q_avg, LogDensityFunction(m)),\n    ELBO_q_last = estimate_objective(AdvancedVI.RepGradELBO(32), q_last, LogDensityFunction(m))\n)\n\n\n┌ Info: Objective of q_avg and q_last\n│   ELBO_q_avg = -52.8918031125194\n└   ELBO_q_last = -54.027615163157115\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that ELBO_q_avg is slightly more optimal.\nNow, info contains information generated during optimization that could be useful for diagnostics.

Furthermore, at each step, the ELBO is evaluated on q_last, not q_avg, which is the actual output that we care about.

Sometimes, the step size of AdvancedVI.DoWG could be too large, resulting in unstable behavior. (In this case, we recommend trying AdvancedVI.DoG19) Or, for whatever reason, it might be desirable to use a different optimiser. Our implementation supports any optimiser that implements the Optimisers.jl interface.\nFor instance, let’s try using Optimisers.Adam20, which is a popular choice. Since AdvancedVI does not implement a proximal operator for Optimisers.Adam, we must use the AdvancedVI.ClipScale() projection operator, which ensures that the scale matrix of the variational approximation is positive definite.

Domke 202021 for more detail about the use of a projection operator.)\n\nusing Optimisers\n\n_, _, info_adam, _ = vi(m, q_init, n_iters; show_progress=false, callback=callback, optimizer=Optimisers.Adam(3e-3), operator=ClipScale());\n\n\niters = 1:10:length(info_mf)\nelbo_adam = [i.elbo_avg for i in info_adam[iters]]\nPlots.plot(iters, elbo_mf, xlabel=\"Iterations\", ylabel=\"ELBO\", label=\"DoWG\")\nPlots.plot!(iters, elbo_adam, xlabel=\"Iterations\", ylabel=\"ELBO\", label=\"Adam\")\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the default option AdvancedVI.DoWG(), we can see that Optimisers.Adam(3e-3) is converging more slowly. With more step size tuning, it is possible that Optimisers.Adam could perform better or equal. That is, most common optimisers require some degree of tuning to perform better or comparably to AdvancedVI.DoWG() or AdvancedVI.DoG(), which do not require much tuning at all. Due to this fact, they are referred to as parameter-free optimizers.",

This term, however, traditionally comes from the fact that full-rank families use full-rank factors in addition to the diagonal of the covariance.\nIn contrast to the mean-field family, the full-rank family will often result in more computation per optimization step and slower convergence, especially in high dimensions:\n\nq_fr, _, info_fr, _ = vi(m, q_init_fr, n_iters; show_progress=false, callback)\n\nPlots.plot(elbo_mf, xlabel=\"Iterations\", ylabel=\"ELBO\", label=\"Mean-Field\", ylims=(-200, Inf))\n\nelbo_fr = [i.elbo_avg for i in info_fr[iters]]\nPlots.plot!(elbo_fr, xlabel=\"Iterations\", ylabel=\"ELBO\", label=\"Full-Rank\", ylims=(-200, Inf))\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we can see that the full-rank families achieve a higher ELBO in the end. Due to the relationship between the ELBO and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, this indicates that the full-rank covariance is much more accurate. This trade-off between statistical accuracy and optimization speed is often referred to as the statistical-computational trade-off. The fact that we can control this trade-off through the choice of variational family is a strength, rather than a limitation, of variational inference.\nWe can also visualize the covariance matrix.\n\nheatmap(cov(rand(q_fr, 100_000), dims=2))",

    "text": "In many applications it is desirable to allow the model to adjust its complexity to the amount of data. Consider for example the task of assigning objects into clusters or groups. This task often involves the specification of the number of groups. However, often times it is not known beforehand how many groups exist. Moreover, in some applictions, e.g. modelling topics in text documents or grouping species, the number of examples per group is heavy tailed. This makes it impossible to predefine the number of groups and requiring the model to form new groups when data points from previously unseen groups are observed.\nA natural approach for such applications is the use of non-parametric models. This tutorial will introduce how to use the Dirichlet process in a mixture of infinitely many Gaussians using Turing. For further information on Bayesian nonparametrics and the Dirichlet process we refer to the introduction by Zoubin Ghahramani and the book “Fundamentals of Nonparametric Bayesian Inference” by Subhashis Ghosal and Aad van der Vaart.\nusing Turing",

Subsequently, we will define how to use the Chinese restaurant process construction of a Dirichlet process for non-parametric clustering.\n\nTwo-Component Model\nFirst, consider the simple case of a mixture model with two Gaussian components with fixed covariance. The generative process of such a model can be written as:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi_1 &\\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(a, b) \\\\\n\\pi_2 &= 1-\\pi_1 \\\\\n\\mu_1 &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_0, \\Sigma_0) \\\\\n\\mu_2 &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_0, \\Sigma_0) \\\\\nz_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Categorical}(\\pi_1, \\pi_2) \\\\\nx_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_{z_i}, \\Sigma)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi_1, \\pi_2\\) are the mixing weights of the mixture model, i.e. \\(\\pi_1 + \\pi_2 = 1\\), and \\(z_i\\) is a latent assignment of the observation \\(x_i\\) to a component (Gaussian).\nWe can implement this model in Turing for 1D data as follows:\n\n@model function two_model(x)\n    # Hyper-parameters\n    μ0 = 0.0\n    σ0 = 1.0\n\n    # Draw weights.\n    π1 ~ Beta(1, 1)\n    π2 = 1 - π1\n\n    # Draw locations of the components.\n    μ1 ~ Normal(μ0, σ0)\n    μ2 ~ Normal(μ0, σ0)\n\n    # Draw latent assignment.\n    z ~ Categorical([π1, π2])\n\n    # Draw observation from selected component.\n    if z == 1\n        x ~ Normal(μ1, 1.0)\n    else\n        x ~ Normal(μ2, 1.0)\n    end\nend\n\ntwo_model (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n\nFinite Mixture Model\nIf we have more than two components, this model can elegantly be extended using a Dirichlet distribution as prior for the mixing weights \\(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_K\\). Note that the Dirichlet distribution is the multivariate generalization of the beta distribution. The resulting model can be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_K) &\\sim Dirichlet(K, \\alpha) \\\\\n\\mu_k &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_0, \\Sigma_0), \\;\\; \\forall k \\\\\nz &\\sim Categorical(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_K) \\\\\nx &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_z, \\Sigma)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhich resembles the model in the Gaussian mixture model tutorial with a slightly different notation.",

    "text": "Infinite Mixture Model\nThe question now arises, is there a generalization of a Dirichlet distribution for which the dimensionality \\(K\\) is infinite, i.e. \\(K = \\infty\\)?\nBut first, to implement an infinite Gaussian mixture model in Turing, we first need to load the Turing.RandomMeasures module. RandomMeasures contains a variety of tools useful in nonparametrics.\n\nusing Turing.RandomMeasures\n\nWe now will utilize the fact that one can integrate out the mixing weights in a Gaussian mixture model allowing us to arrive at the Chinese restaurant process construction. See Carl E. Rasmussen: The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model, NIPS (2000) for details.\nIn fact, if the mixing weights are integrated out, the conditional prior for the latent variable \\(z\\) is given by:\n\\[\np(z_i = k \\mid z_{\\not i}, \\alpha) = \\frac{n_k + \\alpha K}{N - 1 + \\alpha}\n\\]\nwhere \\(z_{\\not i}\\) are the latent assignments of all observations except observation \\(i\\).

The parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is the concentration parameter of the Dirichlet distribution used as prior over the mixing weights.\n\nChinese Restaurant Process\nTo obtain the Chinese restaurant process construction, we can now derive the conditional prior if \\(K \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nFor \\(n_k &gt; 0\\) we obtain:\n\\[\np(z_i = k \\mid z_{\\not i}, \\alpha) = \\frac{n_k}{N - 1 + \\alpha}\n\\]\nand for all infinitely many clusters that are empty (combined) we get:\n\\[\np(z_i = k \\mid z_{\\not i}, \\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha}{N - 1 + \\alpha}\n\\]\nThose equations show that the conditional prior for component assignments is proportional to the number of such observations, meaning that the Chinese restaurant process has a rich get richer property.\nTo get a better understanding of this property, we can plot the cluster choosen by for each new observation drawn from the conditional prior.\n\n# Concentration parameter.\nα = 10.0\n\n# Random measure, e.g. Dirichlet process.\nrpm = DirichletProcess(α)\n\n# Cluster assignments for each observation.\nz = Vector{Int}()\n\n# Maximum number of observations we observe.\nNmax = 500\n\nfor i in 1:Nmax\n    # Number of observations per cluster.\n    K = isempty(z) ? 0 : maximum(z)\n    nk = Vector{Int}(map(k -&gt; sum(z .== k), 1:K))\n\n    # Draw new assignment.\n    push!(z, rand(ChineseRestaurantProcess(rpm, nk)))\nend\n\n\nusing Plots\n\n# Plot the cluster assignments over time\n@gif for i in 1:Nmax\n    scatter(\n        collect(1:i),\n        z[1:i];\n        markersize=2,\n        xlabel=\"observation (i)\",\n        ylabel=\"cluster (k)\",\n        legend=false,\n    )\nend\n\n\nGKS: cannot open display - headless operation mode active\n[ Info: Saved animation to /tmp/jl_NAjuh2rY7o.gif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, we can see that the number of clusters is logarithmic in the number of observations and data points. This is a side-effect of the “rich-get-richer” phenomenon, i.e. we expect large clusters and thus the number of clusters has to be smaller than the number of observations.\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[K \\mid N] \\approx \\alpha \\cdot log \\big(1 + \\frac{N}{\\alpha}\\big)\n\\]\nWe can see from the equation that the concentration parameter \\(\\alpha\\) allows us to control the number of clusters formed a priori.\nIn Turing we can implement an infinite Gaussian mixture model using the Chinese restaurant process construction of a Dirichlet process as follows:\n\n@model function infiniteGMM(x)\n    # Hyper-parameters, i.e. concentration parameter and parameters of H.\n    α = 1.0\n    μ0 = 0.0\n    σ0 = 1.0\n\n    # Define random measure, e.g. Dirichlet process.\n    rpm = DirichletProcess(α)\n\n    # Define the base distribution, i.e. expected value of the Dirichlet process.\n    H = Normal(μ0, σ0)\n\n    # Latent assignment.\n    z = zeros(Int, length(x))\n\n    # Locations of the infinitely many clusters.\n    μ = zeros(Float64, 0)\n\n    for i in 1:length(x)\n\n        # Number of clusters.\n        K = maximum(z)\n        nk = Vector{Int}(map(k -&gt; sum(z .== k), 1:K))\n\n        # Draw the latent assignment.\n        z[i] ~ ChineseRestaurantProcess(rpm, nk)\n\n        # Create a new cluster?\n        if z[i] &gt; K\n            push!(μ, 0.0)\n\n            # Draw location of new cluster.\n            μ[z[i]] ~ H\n        end\n\n        # Draw observation.\n        x[i] ~ Normal(μ[z[i]], 1.0)\n    end\nend\n\ninfiniteGMM (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nWe can now use Turing to infer the assignments of some data points. First, we will create some random data that comes from three clusters, with means of 0, -5, and 10.\n\nusing Plots, Random\n\n# Generate some test data.\nRandom.seed!(1)\ndata = vcat(randn(10), randn(10) .- 5, randn(10) .+ 10)\ndata .-= mean(data)\ndata /= std(data);\n\nNext, we’ll sample from our posterior using SMC.\n\nsetprogress!(false)\n\n\n# MCMC sampling\nRandom.seed!(2)\niterations = 1000\nmodel_fun = infiniteGMM(data);\nchain = sample(model_fun, SMC(), iterations);\n\nFinally, we can plot the number of clusters in each sample.\n\n# Extract the number of clusters for each sample of the Markov chain.\nk = map(\n    t -&gt; length(unique(vec(chain[t, MCMCChains.namesingroup(chain, :z), :].value))),\n    1:iterations,\n);\n\n# Visualize the number of clusters.\nplot(k; xlabel=\"Iteration\", ylabel=\"Number of clusters\", label=\"Chain 1\")\n\n\n\n\nIf we visualize the histogram of the number of clusters sampled from our posterior, we observe that the model seems to prefer 3 clusters, which is the true number of clusters. Note that the number of clusters in a Dirichlet process mixture model is not limited a priori and will grow to infinity with probability one. However, if conditioned on data the posterior will concentrate on a finite number of clusters enforcing the resulting model to have a finite amount of clusters. It is, however, not given that the posterior of a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model converges to the true number of clusters, given that data comes from a finite mixture model. See Jeffrey Miller and Matthew Harrison: A simple example of Dirichlet process mixture inconsitency for the number of components for details.\n\nhistogram(k; xlabel=\"Number of clusters\", legend=false)\n\n\n\n\nOne issue with the Chinese restaurant process construction is that the number of latent parameters we need to sample scales with the number of observations. It may be desirable to use alternative constructions in certain cases. Alternative methods of constructing a Dirichlet process can be employed via the following representations:\nSize-Biased Sampling Process\n\\[\nj_k \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(1, \\alpha) \\cdot \\mathrm{surplus}\n\\]\nStick-Breaking Process \\[\nv_k \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(1, \\alpha)\n\\]\nChinese Restaurant Process \\[\np(z_n = k | z_{1:n-1}) \\propto \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{m_k}{n-1+\\alpha}, \\text{ if } m_k &gt; 0\\\\\\\n\\frac{\\alpha}{n-1+\\alpha}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFor more details see this article.",

We need to build a prediction function that takes the test object we made earlier and runs it through the average parameter calculated during sampling.\nThe prediction function below takes a Matrix and a Chain object. It takes the mean of each parameter’s sampled values and re-runs the logistic function using those mean values for every element in the test set.\n\nfunction prediction(x::Matrix, chain, threshold)\n    # Pull the means from each parameter's sampled values in the chain.\n    intercept = mean(chain[:intercept])\n    student = mean(chain[:student])\n    balance = mean(chain[:balance])\n    income = mean(chain[:income])\n\n    # Retrieve the number of rows.\n    n, _ = size(x)\n\n    # Generate a vector to store our predictions.\n    v = Vector{Float64}(undef, n)\n\n    # Calculate the logistic function for each element in the test set.\n    for i in 1:n\n        num = logistic(\n            intercept .+ student * x[i, 1] + balance * x[i, 2] + income * x[i, 3]\n        )\n        if num &gt;= threshold\n            v[i] = 1\n        else\n            v[i] = 0\n        end\n    end\n    return v\nend;\n\nLet’s see how we did! We run the test matrix through the prediction function, and compute the mean squared error (MSE) for our prediction. The threshold variable sets the sensitivity of the predictions. For example, a threshold of 0.07 will predict a defualt value of 1 for any predicted value greater than 0.07 and no default if it is less than 0.07.\n\n# Set the prediction threshold.\nthreshold = 0.07\n\n# Make the predictions.\npredictions = prediction(test, chain, threshold)\n\n# Calculate MSE for our test set.\nloss = sum((predictions - test_label) .^ 2) / length(test_label)\n\n0.13010526315789472\n\n\nPerhaps more important is to see what percentage of defaults we correctly predicted.

This is fairly sensitive to a choice of threshold, and you may wish to experiment with it.\nThis tutorial has demonstrated how to use Turing to perform Bayesian logistic regression.",

We want to find values of these four coefficients to predict any given y.\nIntuitively, we can think of the coefficients as:\n\nb1 is the coefficient which represents the effect of taking alcohol on the number of sneezes;\nb2 is the coefficient which represents the effect of taking in no medicines on the number of sneezes;\nb3 is the coefficient which represents the effect of interaction between taking alcohol and no medicine on the number of sneezes;\n\nThe for block creates a variable theta which is the weighted combination of the input features. We have defined the priors on these weights above. We then observe the likelihood of calculating theta given the actual label, y[i].\n\n# Bayesian poisson regression (LR)\n@model function poisson_regression(x, y, n, σ²)\n    b0 ~ Normal(0, σ²)\n    b1 ~ Normal(0, σ²)\n    b2 ~ Normal(0, σ²)\n    b3 ~ Normal(0, σ²)\n    for i in 1:n\n        theta = b0 + b1 * x[i, 1] + b2 * x[i, 2] + b3 * x[i, 3]\n        y[i] ~ Poisson(exp(theta))\n    end\nend;\n\n\n\nSampling from the posterior\nWe use the NUTS sampler to sample values from the posterior. We run multiple chains using the MCMCThreads() function to nullify the effect of a problematic chain. We then use the Gelman, Rubin, and Brooks Diagnostic to check the convergence of these multiple chains.\n\n# Retrieve the number of observations.\nn, _ = size(data)\n\n# Sample using NUTS.\n\nnum_chains = 4\nm = poisson_regression(data, data_labels, n, 10)\nchain = sample(m, NUTS(), MCMCThreads(), 2_500, num_chains; discard_adapt=false, progress=false)\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (2500×18×4 Array{Union{Missing, Float64}, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:2500\nNumber of chains  = 4\nSamples per chain = 2500\nWall duration     = 19.9 seconds\nCompute duration  = 16.22 seconds\nparameters        = b0, b1, b2, b3\ninternals         = hamiltonian_energy, n_steps, numerical_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, loglikelihood, hamiltonian_energy_error, is_accept, logprior, log_density, tree_depth, step_size, acceptance_rate, lp, nom_step_size\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningSampling With Multiple Threads\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample() call above assumes that you have at least nchains threads available in your Julia instance. If you do not, the multiple chains will run sequentially, and you may notice a warning. For more information, see the Turing documentation on sampling multiple chains.\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing the Diagnostics\nWe use the Gelman, Rubin, and Brooks Diagnostic to check whether our chains have converged. Note that we require multiple chains to use this diagnostic which analyses the difference between these multiple chains.\nWe expect the chains to have converged. This is because we have taken sufficient number of iterations (1500) for the NUTS sampler. However, in case the test fails, then we will have to take a larger number of iterations, resulting in longer computation time.\n\n# Because some of the sampler statistics are `missing`, we need to extract only\n# the parameters and then concretize the array so that `gelmandiag` can be computed.\nparameter_chain = MCMCChains.concretize(MCMCChains.get_sections(chain, :parameters))\ngelmandiag(parameter_chain)\n\n\nGelman, Rubin, and Brooks diagnostic\n  parameters      psrf    psrfci\n      Symbol   Float64   Float64\n\n          b0    1.1295    1.1534\n          b1    1.0086    1.0115\n          b2    1.0531    1.0744\n          b3    1.0095    1.0110\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above diagnostic, we can conclude that the chains have converged because the PSRF values of the coefficients are close to 1.\nSo, we have obtained the posterior distributions of the parameters. We transform the coefficients and recover theta values by taking the exponent of the meaned values of the coefficients b0, b1, b2 and b3. We take the exponent of the means to get a better comparison of the relative values of the coefficients. We then compare this with the intuitive meaning that was described earlier.\n\n# Taking the first chain\nc1 = chain[:, :, 1]\n\n# Calculating the exponentiated means\nb0_exp = exp(mean(c1[:b0]))\nb1_exp = exp(mean(c1[:b1]))\nb2_exp = exp(mean(c1[:b2]))\nb3_exp = exp(mean(c1[:b3]))\n\nprint(\"The exponent of the meaned values of the weights (or coefficients are): \\n\")\nprintln(\"b0: \", b0_exp)\nprintln(\"b1: \", b1_exp)\nprintln(\"b2: \", b2_exp)\nprintln(\"b3: \", b3_exp)\nprint(\"The posterior distributions obtained after sampling can be visualised as :\\n\")\n\nThe exponent of the meaned values of the weights (or coefficients are): \nb0: 4.827733005216986\nb1: 1.9345473994481137\nb2: 2.7091985200872264\nb3: 1.2174177577645324\nThe posterior distributions obtained after sampling can be visualised as :\n\n\nVisualising the posterior by plotting it:\n\nplot(chain)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the Obtained Mean Values\nThe exponentiated mean of the coefficient b1 is roughly half of that of b2. This makes sense because in the data that we generated, the number of sneezes was more sensitive to the medicinal intake as compared to the alcohol consumption. We also get a weaker dependence on the interaction between the alcohol consumption and the medicinal intake as can be seen from the value of b3.\n\n\nRemoving the Warmup Samples\nAs can be seen from the plots above, the parameters converge to their final distributions after a few iterations. The initial values during the warmup phase increase the standard deviations of the parameters and are not required after we get the desired distributions. Thus, we remove these warmup values and once again view the diagnostics. To remove these warmup values, we take all values except the first 200. This is because we set the second parameter of the NUTS sampler (which is the number of adaptations) to be equal to 200.\n\nchains_new = chain[201:end, :, :]\n\nChains MCMC chain (2300×18×4 Array{Union{Missing, Float64}, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 201:1:2500\nNumber of chains  = 4\nSamples per chain = 2300\nWall duration     = 19.9 seconds\nCompute duration  = 16.22 seconds\nparameters        = b0, b1, b2, b3\ninternals         = hamiltonian_energy, n_steps, numerical_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, loglikelihood, hamiltonian_energy_error, is_accept, logprior, log_density, tree_depth, step_size, acceptance_rate, lp, nom_step_size\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\nplot(chains_new)\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen from the numeric values and the plots above, the standard deviation values have decreased and all the plotted values are from the estimated posteriors. The exponentiated mean values, with the warmup samples removed, have not changed by much and they are still in accordance with their intuitive meanings as described earlier.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Contexts within contexts\nLet’s use the above two contexts to provide a slightly more general definition of the SamplingContext and the Metropolis-Hastings sampler we wrote in the mini Turing tutorial.\n\nstruct SamplingContext{S&lt;:AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler,R&lt;:Random.AbstractRNG}\n    rng::R\n    sampler::S\n    subcontext::Union{PriorContext, JointContext}\nend\n\nThe new aspect here is the subcontext field. Note that this is a context within a context! The idea is that we don’t need to hard code how the MCMC sampler evaluates the log probability, but rather can pass that work onto the subcontext. This way the same sampler can be used to sample from either the joint or the prior distribution.\nThe methods for SamplingContext are largely as in the our earlier mini Turing case, except they now pass some of the work onto the subcontext:\n\nfunction observe(context::SamplingContext, args...)\n    # Sampling doesn't affect the observed values, so nothing to do here other than pass to\n    # the subcontext.\n    return observe(context.subcontext, args...)\nend\n\nstruct PriorSampler &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler end\n\nfunction assume(context::SamplingContext{PriorSampler}, varinfo, dist, var_id)\n    sample = Random.rand(context.rng, dist)\n    varinfo[var_id] = (sample, NaN)\n    # Once the value has been sampled, let the subcontext handle evaluating the log\n    # probability.\n    return assume(context.subcontext, varinfo, dist, var_id)\nend;\n\n# The subcontext field of the MHSampler determines which distribution this sampler\n# samples from.\nstruct MHSampler{D, T&lt;:Real} &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler\n    sigma::T\n    subcontext::D\nend\n\nMHSampler(subcontext) = MHSampler(1, subcontext)\n\nfunction assume(context::SamplingContext{&lt;:MHSampler}, varinfo, dist, var_id)\n    sampler = context.sampler\n    old_value = varinfo.values[var_id]\n\n    # propose a random-walk step, i.e, add the current value to a random \n    # value sampled from a Normal distribution centered at 0\n    value = rand(context.rng, Normal(old_value, sampler.sigma))\n    varinfo[var_id] = (value, NaN)\n    # Once the value has been sampled, let the subcontext handle evaluating the log\n    # probability.\n    return assume(context.subcontext, varinfo, dist, var_id)\nend;\n\n# The following three methods are identical to before, except for passing\n# `sampler.subcontext` to the context SamplingContext.\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG, model::MiniModel, sampler::MHSampler; kwargs...\n)\n    vi = VarInfo()\n    ctx = SamplingContext(rng, PriorSampler(), sampler.subcontext)\n    model.f(vi, ctx, values(model.data)...)\n    return vi, vi\nend\n\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    model::MiniModel,\n    sampler::MHSampler,\n    prev_state::VarInfo; # is just the old trace\n    kwargs...,\n)\n    vi = prev_state\n    new_vi = deepcopy(vi)\n    ctx = SamplingContext(rng, sampler, sampler.subcontext)\n    model.f(new_vi, ctx, values(model.data)...)\n\n    # Compute log acceptance probability\n    # Since the proposal is symmetric the computation can be simplified\n    logα = sum(values(new_vi.logps)) - sum(values(vi.logps))\n\n    # Accept proposal with computed acceptance probability\n    if -Random.randexp(rng) &lt; logα\n        return new_vi, new_vi\n    else\n        return prev_state, prev_state\n    end\nend;\n\nfunction AbstractMCMC.bundle_samples(\n    samples, model::MiniModel, ::MHSampler, ::Any, ::Type{Chains}; kwargs...\n)\n    # We get a vector of traces\n    values = [sample.values for sample in samples]\n    params = [key for key in keys(values[1]) if key ∉ keys(model.data)]\n    vals = reduce(hcat, [value[p] for value in values] for p in params)\n    # Composing the `Chains` data-structure, of which analyzing infrastructure is provided\n    chains = Chains(vals, params)\n    return chains\nend;\n\nWe can use this to sample from the joint distribution just like before:\n\nsample(MiniModel(m, (x=3.0,)), MHSampler(JointContext()), 1_000_000; chain_type=Chains, progress=false)\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000000×2×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:1000000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000000\nparameters        = a, b\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nor we can choose to sample from the prior instead\n\nsample(MiniModel(m, (x=3.0,)), MHSampler(PriorContext()), 1_000_000; chain_type=Chains, progress=false)\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000000×2×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:1000000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000000\nparameters        = a, b\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nOf course, using an MCMC algorithm to sample from the prior is unnecessary and silly (PriorSampler exists, after all), but the point is to illustrate the flexibility of the context system. We could, for instance, use the same setup to implement an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm.\nThe use of contexts also goes far beyond just evaluating log probabilities and sampling. Some examples from Turing are\n\nFixedContext, which fixes some variables to given values and removes them completely from the evaluation of any log probabilities. They power the Turing.fix and Turing.unfix functions.\nConditionContext conditions the model on fixed values for some parameters. They are used by Turing.condition and Turing.decondition, i.e. the model | (parameter=value,) syntax. The difference between fix and condition is whether the log probability for the corresponding variable is included in the overall log density.\nPriorExtractorContext collects information about what the prior distribution of each variable is.\nPrefixContext adds prefixes to variable names, allowing models to be used within other models without variable name collisions.\nPointwiseLikelihoodContext records the log likelihood of each individual variable.\nDebugContext collects useful debugging information while executing the model.\n\nAll of the above are what Turing calls parent contexts, which is to say that they all keep a subcontext just like our above SamplingContext did. Their implementations of assume and observe call the implementation of the subcontext once they are done doing their own work of fixing/conditioning/prefixing/etc. Contexts are often chained, so that e.g. a DebugContext may wrap within it a PrefixContext, which may in turn wrap a ConditionContext, etc. The only contexts that don’t have a subcontext in the Turing are the ones for evaluating the prior, likelihood, and joint distributions. These are called leaf contexts.\nThe above version of mini Turing is still much simpler than the full Turing language, but the principles of how contexts are used are the same.",

Thus, for example:\n\nusing DynamicPPL, Distributions\n\n@model function f()\n    x ~ Normal()\n    return y ~ Normal()\nend\n\n@model function g()\n    return a ~ to_submodel(f())\nend\n\ng (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\ninside the submodel f, the variables x and y become a.x and a.y respectively.

We will return to the ‘manual prefixing’ case later.\n\n\nThe phrase ‘becoming’ a different variable is a little underspecified: it is useful to pinpoint the exact location where the prefixing occurs, which is tilde_assume. The method responsible for it is tilde_assume(::PrefixContext, right, vn, vi): this attaches the prefix in the context to the VarName argument, before recursively calling tilde_assume with the new prefixed VarName. This means that even though a statement x ~ dist still enters the tilde pipeline at the top level as x, if the model evaluation context contains a PrefixContext, any function after tilde_assume(::PrefixContext, ...) will see a.x instead.",

These values may be stored as a Dict which maps VarNames to values, or alternatively as a NamedTuple.

Take these models, for example:\n\n@model function inner()\n    println(\"inner context: $(__model__.context)\")\n    x ~ Normal()\n    return y ~ Normal()\nend\n\n@model function outer()\n    println(\"outer context: $(__model__.context)\")\n    return a ~ to_submodel(inner())\nend\n\n# 'Outer conditioning'\nwith_outer_cond = outer() | (@varname(a.x) =&gt; 1.0)\n\n# 'Inner conditioning'\ninner_cond = inner() | (@varname(x) =&gt; 1.0)\n@model function outer2()\n    println(\"outer context: $(__model__.context)\")\n    return a ~ to_submodel(inner_cond)\nend\nwith_inner_cond = outer2()\n\nModel{typeof(outer2), (), (), (), Tuple{}, Tuple{}, DefaultContext}(outer2, NamedTuple(), NamedTuple(), DefaultContext())\n\n\nWe want that:\n\nkeys(VarInfo(outer())) should return [a.x, a.y];\nkeys(VarInfo(with_outer_cond)) should return [a.y];\nkeys(VarInfo(with_inner_cond)) should return [a.y],\n\nIn other words, we can condition submodels either from the outside (point (2)) or from the inside (point (3)), and the variable name we use to specify the conditioning should match the level at which we perform the conditioning.\nThis is an incredibly salient point because it means that submodels can be treated as individual, opaque objects, and we can condition them without needing to know what it will be prefixed with, or the context in which that submodel is being used. For example, this means we can reuse inner_cond in another model with a different prefix, and it will still have its inner x value be conditioned, despite the prefix differing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the current version of DynamicPPL, these criteria are all fulfilled. However, this was not the case in the past: in particular, point (3) was not fulfilled, and users had to condition the internal submodel with the prefixes that were used outside.

    "text": "Desiderata at the context level\nThe above section describes how we expect conditioning and prefixing to behave from a user’s perpective. We now turn to the question of how we implement this in terms of DynamicPPL contexts. We do not specify the implementation details here, but we will sketch out something resembling an API that will allow us to achieve the target behaviour.\nPoint (1) does not involve any conditioning, only prefixing; it is therefore already satisfied by virtue of the tilde_assume method shown above.\nPoints (2) and (3) are more tricky. As the reader may surmise, the difference between them is the order in which the contexts are stacked.\nFor the outer conditioning case (point (2)), the ConditionContext will contain a VarName that is already prefixed. When we enter the inner submodel, this ConditionContext has to be passed down and somehow combined with the PrefixContext that is created when we enter the submodel. We make the claim here that the best way to do this is to nest the PrefixContext inside the ConditionContext. This is indeed what happens, as can be demonstrated by running the model.\n\nwith_outer_cond()\n\nouter context: ConditionContext(Dict(a.x =&gt; 1.0), DynamicPPL.InitContext{Random.TaskLocalRNG, DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior}(Random.TaskLocalRNG(), DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior()))\ninner context: ConditionContext(Dict(a.x =&gt; 1.0), DynamicPPL.PrefixContext{AbstractPPL.VarName{:a, typeof(identity)}, DynamicPPL.InitContext{Random.TaskLocalRNG, DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior}}(a, DynamicPPL.InitContext{Random.TaskLocalRNG, DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior}(Random.TaskLocalRNG(), DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior())))\n\n\n0.9121270959468942\n\n\nFor the inner conditioning case (point (3)), the outer model is not run with any special context. The inner model will itself contain a ConditionContext will contain a VarName that is not prefixed. When we run the model, this ConditionContext should be then nested inside a PrefixContext to form the final evaluation context. Again, we can run the model to see this in action:\n\nwith_inner_cond()\n\nouter context: DynamicPPL.InitContext{Random.TaskLocalRNG, DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior}(Random.TaskLocalRNG(), DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior())\ninner context: DynamicPPL.PrefixContext{AbstractPPL.VarName{:a, typeof(identity)}, DynamicPPL.ConditionContext{Dict{AbstractPPL.VarName{:x, typeof(identity)}, Float64}, DynamicPPL.InitContext{Random.TaskLocalRNG, DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior}}}(a, ConditionContext(Dict(x =&gt; 1.0), DynamicPPL.InitContext{Random.TaskLocalRNG, DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior}(Random.TaskLocalRNG(), DynamicPPL.InitFromPrior())))\n\n\n0.7437823646419611\n\n\nPutting all of the information so far together, what it means is that if we have these two inner contexts (taken from above):\n\nusing DynamicPPL: PrefixContext, ConditionContext, DefaultContext\n\ninner_ctx_with_outer_cond = ConditionContext(\n    Dict(@varname(a.x) =&gt; 1.0), PrefixContext(@varname(a))\n)\ninner_ctx_with_inner_cond = PrefixContext(\n    @varname(a), ConditionContext(Dict(@varname(x) =&gt; 1.0))\n)\n\nPrefixContext{VarName{:a, typeof(identity)}, ConditionContext{Dict{VarName{:x, typeof(identity)}, Float64}, DefaultContext}}(a, ConditionContext(Dict(x =&gt; 1.0), DynamicPPL.DefaultContext()))\n\n\nthen we want both of these to be true (and thankfully, they are!):\n\nDynamicPPL.hasconditioned_nested(inner_ctx_with_outer_cond, @varname(a.x))\n\ntrue\n\n\n\nDynamicPPL.hasconditioned_nested(inner_ctx_with_inner_cond, @varname(a.x))\n\ntrue\n\n\nThis allows us to finally specify our task as follows:\n\nGiven the correct arguments, we need to make sure that hasconditioned_nested and getconditioned_nested behave correctly.\nWe need to make sure that both the correct arguments are supplied. In order to do so:\n\n\n(2a) We need to make sure that when evaluating a submodel, the context stack is arranged such that PrefixContext is applied inside the parent model’s context, but outside the submodel’s own context.\n(2b) We also need to make sure that the VarName passed to it is prefixed correctly.",

Once the PrefixContexts have been removed, one can then iterate through the context stack and check if any of the ConditionContexts contain the variable, or get the value itself. For more details the reader is encouraged to read the source code.\n\n(2a) We ensure that the context stack is correctly arranged by relying on the behaviour of make_evaluate_args_and_kwargs. This function is called whenever a model (which itself contains a context) is evaluated with a separate (‘external’) context, and makes sure to arrange both of these contexts such that the model’s context is nested inside the external context. Thus, as long as prefixing is implemented by applying a PrefixContext on the outermost layer of the inner model context, this will be correctly combined with an external context to give the behaviour seen above.\n(2b) At first glance, it seems like tilde_assume can take care of the VarName prefixing for us (as described in the first section). However, this is not actually the case: contextual_isassumption, which is the function that calls hasconditioned_nested, is much higher in the call stack than tilde_assume is. So, we need to explicitly prefix it before passing it to contextual_isassumption. This is done inside the @model macro, or technically, its subsidiary function isassumption.",

    "text": "Nested submodels\nJust in case the above wasn’t complicated enough, we need to also be very careful when dealing with nested submodels, which have multiple layers of PrefixContexts which may be interspersed with ConditionContexts. For example, in this series of nested submodels,\n\n@model function charlie()\n    x ~ Normal()\n    y ~ Normal()\n    return z ~ Normal()\nend\n@model function bravo()\n    return b ~ to_submodel(charlie() | (@varname(x) =&gt; 1.0))\nend\n@model function alpha()\n    return a ~ to_submodel(bravo() | (@varname(b.y) =&gt; 1.0))\nend\n\nalpha (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nwe expect that the only variable to be sampled should be z inside charlie, or rather, a.b.z once it has been through the prefixes.\n\nkeys(VarInfo(alpha()))\n\n1-element Vector{VarName{:a, ComposedFunction{Accessors.PropertyLens{:z}, Accessors.PropertyLens{:b}}}}:\n a.b.z\n\n\nThe general strategy that we adopt is similar to above. Following the principle that PrefixContext should be nested inside the outer context, but outside the inner submodel’s context, we can infer that the correct context inside charlie should be:\n\nbig_ctx = PrefixContext(\n    @varname(a),\n    ConditionContext(\n        Dict(@varname(b.y) =&gt; 1.0),\n        PrefixContext(@varname(b), ConditionContext(Dict(@varname(x) =&gt; 1.0))),\n    ),\n)\n\nPrefixContext{VarName{:a, typeof(identity)}, ConditionContext{Dict{VarName{:b, Accessors.PropertyLens{:y}}, Float64}, PrefixContext{VarName{:b, typeof(identity)}, ConditionContext{Dict{VarName{:x, typeof(identity)}, Float64}, DefaultContext}}}}(a, ConditionContext(Dict(b.y =&gt; 1.0), DynamicPPL.PrefixContext{AbstractPPL.VarName{:b, typeof(identity)}, DynamicPPL.ConditionContext{Dict{AbstractPPL.VarName{:x, typeof(identity)}, Float64}, DynamicPPL.DefaultContext}}(b, ConditionContext(Dict(x =&gt; 1.0), DynamicPPL.DefaultContext()))))\n\n\nWe need several things to work correctly here: we need the VarName prefixing to behave correctly, and then we need to implement hasconditioned_nested and getconditioned_nested on the resulting prefixed VarName. It turns out that the prefixing itself is enough to illustrate the most important point in this section, namely, the need to traverse the context stack in a different direction to what most of DynamicPPL does.\nLet’s work with a function called myprefix(::AbstractContext, ::VarName) (to avoid confusion with any existing DynamicPPL function). We should like myprefix(big_ctx, @varname(x)) to return @varname(a.b.x). Consider the following naive implementation, which mirrors a lot of code in the tilde-pipeline:\n\nusing DynamicPPL: NodeTrait, IsLeaf, IsParent, childcontext, AbstractContext\nusing AbstractPPL: AbstractPPL\n\nfunction myprefix(ctx::DynamicPPL.AbstractContext, vn::VarName)\n    return myprefix(NodeTrait(ctx), ctx, vn)\nend\nfunction myprefix(::IsLeaf, ::AbstractContext, vn::VarName)\n    return vn\nend\nfunction myprefix(::IsParent, ctx::AbstractContext, vn::VarName)\n    return myprefix(childcontext(ctx), vn)\nend\nfunction myprefix(ctx::DynamicPPL.PrefixContext, vn::VarName)\n    # The functionality to actually manipulate the VarNames is in AbstractPPL\n    new_vn = AbstractPPL.prefix(vn, ctx.vn_prefix)\n    # Then pass to the child context\n    return myprefix(childcontext(ctx), new_vn)\nend\n\nmyprefix(big_ctx, @varname(x))\n\nb.a.x\n\n\nThis implementation clearly is not correct, because it applies the inner PrefixContext before the outer one.\nThe right way to implement myprefix is to, essentially, reverse the order of two lines above:\n\nfunction myprefix(ctx::DynamicPPL.PrefixContext, vn::VarName)\n    # Pass to the child context first\n    new_vn = myprefix(childcontext(ctx), vn)\n    # Then apply this context's prefix\n    return AbstractPPL.prefix(new_vn, ctx.vn_prefix)\nend\n\nmyprefix(big_ctx, @varname(x))\n\na.b.x\n\n\nThis is a much better result! The implementation of related functions such as hasconditioned_nested and getconditioned_nested, under the hood, use a similar recursion scheme, so you will find that this is a common pattern when reading the source code of various prefixing-related functions. When editing this code, it is worth being mindful of this as a potential source of incorrectness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have encountered left and right folds, the above discussion illustrates the difference between them: the wrong implementation of myprefix uses a left fold (which collects prefixes in the opposite order from which they are encountered), while the correct implementation uses a right fold.",

However, each random variable in the model will have its own distribution, and often some of these will be constrained. For example, if b ~ LogNormal() is a random variable in a model, then \\(p(b)\\) will be zero for any \\(b \\leq 0\\). Consequently, any joint probability \\(p(b, c, \\ldots)\\) will also be zero for any combination of parameters where \\(b \\leq 0\\), and so that joint distribution is itself constrained.\nTo get around this, DynamicPPL allows the variables to be transformed in exactly the same way as above. For simplicity, consider the following model:\n\nusing DynamicPPL\n\n@model function demo()\n    x ~ LogNormal()\nend\n\nmodel = demo()\nvi = VarInfo(model)\nvn_x = @varname(x)\n# Retrieve the 'internal' representation of x – we'll explain this later\nDynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi, vn_x)\n\n1-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0746648736094493\n\n\nThe call to VarInfo executes the model once and stores the sampled value inside vi. By default, VarInfo itself stores un-transformed values. We can see this by comparing the value of the logpdf stored inside the VarInfo:\n\nDynamicPPL.getlogp(vi)\n\n(logprior = -0.9935400392011169, logjac = 0.0, loglikelihood = 0.0)\n\n\nwith a manual calculation:\n\nlogpdf(LogNormal(), DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi, vn_x))\n\n1-element Vector{Float64}:\n -0.9935400392011169\n\n\nIn DynamicPPL, the link function can be used to transform the variables. This function does three things: firstly, it transforms the variables; secondly, it updates the value of logp (by adding the Jacobian term); and thirdly, it sets a flag on the variables to indicate that it has been transformed. Note that this acts on all variables in the model, including unconstrained ones. (Unconstrained variables just have an identity transformation.)\n\nvi_linked = DynamicPPL.link(vi, model)\nprintln(\"Transformed value: $(DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi_linked, vn_x))\")\nprintln(\"Transformed logp: $(DynamicPPL.getlogp(vi_linked))\")\nprintln(\"Transformed flag: $(DynamicPPL.is_transformed(vi_linked, vn_x))\")\n\nTransformed value: [0.07200886749732066]\nTransformed logp: (logprior = -0.9935400392011169, logjac = -0.07200886749732066, loglikelihood = 0.0)\nTransformed flag: true\n\n\nIndeed, we can see that the new logp value matches with\n\nlogpdf(Normal(), DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi_linked, vn_x))\n\n1-element Vector{Float64}:\n -0.9215311717037962\n\n\nThe reverse transformation, invlink, reverts all of the above steps:\n\nvi = DynamicPPL.invlink(vi_linked, model)  # Same as the previous vi\nprintln(\"Un-transformed value: $(DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi, vn_x))\")\nprintln(\"Un-transformed logp: $(DynamicPPL.getlogp(vi))\")\nprintln(\"Un-transformed flag: $(DynamicPPL.is_transformed(vi, vn_x))\")\n\nUn-transformed value: [1.0746648736094493]\nUn-transformed logp: (logprior = -0.9935400392011169, logjac = 0.0, loglikelihood = 0.0)\nUn-transformed flag: false\n\n\n\nModel and internal representations\nIn DynamicPPL, there is a difference between the value of a random variable and its ‘internal’ value. This is most easily seen by first transforming, and then comparing the output of getindex and getindex_internal. The former extracts the regular value, which we call the model representation (because it is consistent with the distribution specified in the model). The latter, as the name suggests, gets the internal representation of the variable, which is how it is actually stored in the VarInfo object.\n\nprintln(\"   Model representation: $(getindex(vi_linked, vn_x))\")\nprintln(\"Internal representation: $(DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi_linked, vn_x))\")\n\n   Model representation: 1.0746648736094493\nInternal representation: [0.07200886749732066]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that vi_linked[vn_x] can also be used as shorthand for getindex(vi_linked, vn_x); this usage is common in the DynamicPPL/Turing codebase.\n\n\nWe can see (for this linked varinfo) that there are two differences between these outputs:\n\nThe internal representation has been transformed using the bijector (in this case, the log function). This means that the is_transformed() flag which we used above doesn’t modify the model representation: it only tells us whether the internal representation has been transformed or not.\nThe internal representation is a vector, whereas the model representation is a scalar. This is because in DynamicPPL, all internal values are vectorised (i.e. converted into some vector), regardless of distribution. On the other hand, since the model specifies a univariate distribution, the model representation is a scalar.\n\nOne might also ask, what is the internal representation for an unlinked varinfo?\n\nprintln(\"   Model representation: $(getindex(vi, vn_x))\")\nprintln(\"Internal representation: $(DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi, vn_x))\")\n\n   Model representation: 1.0746648736094493\nInternal representation: [1.0746648736094493]\n\n\nFor an unlinked VarInfo, the internal representation is vectorised, but not transformed. We call this an unlinked internal representation; conversely, when the VarInfo has been linked, each variable will have a corresponding linked internal representation.\nThis sequence of events is summed up in the following diagram, where f(..., args) indicates that the ... is to be replaced with the object at the beginning of the arrow:\n\n\n\nFunctions related to variable transforms in DynamicPPL\n\n\nIn the final part of this article, we’ll take a more in-depth look at the internal DynamicPPL machinery that allows us to convert between representations and obtain the correct probability densities. Before that, though, we’ll take a quick high-level look at how the HMC sampler in Turing.jl uses the functions introduced so far.",

    "text": "Case study: HMC in Turing.jl\nWhile DynamicPPL provides the functionality for transforming variables, the transformation itself happens at an even higher level, i.e. in the sampler itself. The HMC sampler in Turing.jl is in this file. In the first step of sampling, it calls link on the sampler. This transformation is preserved throughout the sampling process, meaning that is_transformed() always returns true.\nWe can observe this by inserting print statements into the model. Here, __varinfo__ is the internal symbol for the VarInfo object used in model evaluation:\n\nsetprogress!(false)\n\n@model function demo2()\n    x ~ LogNormal()\n    if x isa AbstractFloat\n        println(\"-----------\")\n        println(\"model repn: $(DynamicPPL.getindex(__varinfo__, @varname(x)))\")\n        println(\"internal repn: $(DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(__varinfo__, @varname(x)))\")\n        println(\"is_transformed: $(is_transformed(__varinfo__, @varname(x)))\")\n    end\nend\n\nsample(demo2(), HMC(0.1, 3), 3);\n\n\n[ Info: [Turing]: progress logging is disabled globally\n-----------\nmodel repn: 0.9286310592520649\ninternal repn: Real[0.9286310592520649]\nis_transformed: false\n-----------\nmodel repn: 1.8828305151849143\ninternal repn: Real[1.8828305151849143]\nis_transformed: false\n-----------\nmodel repn: 3.5763668558448924\ninternal repn: [3.5763668558448924]\nis_transformed: false\n-----------\nmodel repn: 3.5763668558448924\ninternal repn: [1.2743474403729613]\nis_transformed: true\n-----------\nmodel repn: 3.1812030111840937\ninternal repn: [1.1572594306564412]\nis_transformed: true\n-----------\nmodel repn: 2.7058579232090407\ninternal repn: [0.9954190240128553]\nis_transformed: true\n\n\n\n\n(Here, the check on if x isa AbstractFloat prevents the printing from occurring during computation of the derivative.) You can see that during the three sampling steps, is_transformed is always kept as true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first two model evaluations where is_transformed is false occur prior to the actual sampling. One occurs when the model is checked for correctness (using DynamicPPL.check_model_and_trace). The second occurs because the model is evaluated once to generate a set of initial parameters inside DynamicPPL’s implementation of AbstractMCMC.step. Both of these steps occur with all samplers in Turing.jl, so are not specific to the HMC example shown here.\n\n\nWhat this means is that from the perspective of the HMC sampler, it never sees the constrained variable: it always thinks that it is sampling from an unconstrained distribution.\nThe biggest prerequisite for this to work correctly is that the potential energy term in the Hamiltonian—or in other words, the model log density—must be programmed correctly to include the Jacobian term. This is exactly the same as how we had to make sure to define logq(y) correctly in the toy HMC example above.\nWithin Turing.jl, this is correctly handled because a statement like x ~ LogNormal() in the model definition above is translated into assume(LogNormal(), @varname(x), __varinfo__), defined here. If you follow the trail of function calls, you can verify that the assume function does indeed check for the presence of the is_transformed flag and adds the Jacobian term accordingly.",

    "text": "A deeper dive into DynamicPPL’s internal machinery\nAs described above, DynamicPPL stores a (possibly linked) internal representation which is accessible via getindex_internal, but can also provide users with the original, untransformed, model representation via getindex. This abstraction allows the user to obtain samples from constrained distributions without having to perform the transformation themselves.\n\n\n\nMore functions related to variable transforms in DynamicPPL\n\n\nThe conversion between these representations is done using several internal functions in DynamicPPL, as depicted in the above diagram. The following operations are labelled:\n\nThis is linking, i.e. transforming a constrained variable to an unconstrained one.\nThis is vectorisation: for example, converting a scalar value to a 1-element vector.\nThis arrow brings us from the model representation to the linked internal representation. This is the composition of (1) and (2): linking and then vectorising.\nThis arrow brings us from the model representation to the unlinked internal representation. This only requires a single step, vectorisation.\n\nEach of these steps can be accomplished using the following functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the function\nTo get the inverse function\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nlink_transform(dist)\ninvlink_transform(dist)\n\n\n(2)\nto_vec_transform(dist)\nfrom_vec_transform(dist)\n\n\n(3)\nto_linked_internal_transform(vi, vn[, dist])\nfrom_linked_internal_transform(vi, vn[, dist])\n\n\n(4)\nto_internal_transform(vi, vn[, dist])\nfrom_internal_transform(vi, vn[, dist])\n\n\n\nNote that these functions do not perform the actual transformation; rather, they return the transformation function itself. For example, let’s take a look at the VarInfo from the previous section, which contains a single variable x ~ LogNormal().\n\nmodel_repn = vi[vn_x]\n\n1.0746648736094493\n\n\n\n# (1) Get the link function\nf_link = DynamicPPL.link_transform(LogNormal())\n# (2) Get the vectorise function\nf_vec = DynamicPPL.to_vec_transform(LogNormal())\n\n# Apply it to the model representation\nlinked_internal_repn = f_vec(f_link(model_repn))\n\n1-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.07200886749732066\n\n\nEquivalently, we could have done:\n\n# (3) Get the linked internal transform function\nf_linked_internal = DynamicPPL.to_linked_internal_transform(vi, vn_x, LogNormal())\n\n# Apply it to the model representation\nlinked_internal_repn = f_linked_internal(model_repn)\n\n1-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.07200886749732066\n\n\nAnd let’s confirm that this is the same as the linked internal representation, using the VarInfo that we linked earlier:\n\nDynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi_linked, vn_x)\n\n1-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.07200886749732066\n\n\nThe purpose of having all of these machinery is to allow other parts of DynamicPPL, such as the tilde pipeline, to handle transformed variables correctly. The following diagram shows how assume first checks whether the variable is transformed (using is_transformed), and then applies the appropriate transformation function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{ init: { 'themeVariables': { 'lineColor': '#000000' } } }%%\n%%{ init: { 'flowchart': { 'curve': 'linear', 'wrappingWidth': -1 } } }%%\ngraph TD\n    A[\"x ~ LogNormal()\"]:::boxStyle\n    B[\"vn = &lt;span style='color:#3B6EA8 !important;'&gt;@varname&lt;/span&gt;(x)&lt;br&gt;dist = LogNormal()&lt;br&gt;x, vi = ...\"]:::boxStyle\n    C[\"assume(vn, dist, vi)\"]:::boxStyle\n    D([\"&lt;span style='color:#3B6EA8 !important;'&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; is_transformed(vi, vn)\"]):::boxStyle\n    E[\"f = from_internal_transform(vi, vn, dist)\"]:::boxStyle\n    F[\"f = from_linked_internal_transform(vi, vn, dist)\"]:::boxStyle\n    G[\"x, logjac = with_logabsdet_jacobian(f, getindex_internal(vi, vn, dist))\"]:::boxStyle\n    H[\"&lt;span style='color:#3B6EA8 !important;'&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; x, logpdf(dist, x) - logjac, vi\"]:::boxStyle\n    \n    A -.-&gt;|&lt;span style='color:#3B6EA8 ; background-color:#ffffff;'&gt;@model&lt;/span&gt;| B\n    B -.-&gt;|&lt;span style='color:#000000 ; background-color:#ffffff;'&gt;tilde-pipeline&lt;/span&gt;| C\n    C --&gt; D\n    D --&gt;|&lt;span style='color:#97365B ; background-color:#ffffff;'&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;| E\n    D --&gt;|&lt;span style='color:#97365B ; background-color:#ffffff;'&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;| F\n    E --&gt; G\n    F --&gt; G\n    G --&gt; H\n\n    classDef boxStyle fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,font-family:Courier,color:#000000\n    linkStyle default stroke:#000000,stroke-width:1px,color:#000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, with_logabsdet_jacobian is defined in the ChangesOfVariables.jl package, and returns both the effect of the transformation f as well as the log Jacobian term.\nBecause we chose f appropriately, we find here that x is always the model representation; furthermore, if the variable was not linked (i.e. is_transformed was false), the log Jacobian term will be zero. However, if it was linked, then the Jacobian term would be appropriately included, making sure that sampling proceeds correctly.",

    "text": "Why do we need to do this at runtime?\nGiven that we know whether a VarInfo is linked or not, one might wonder why we need both from_internal_transform and from_linked_internal_transform at the point where the model is evaluated.

Consider, for example, the following model:\n\n@model function demo_dynamic_constraint()\n    m ~ Normal()\n    x ~ truncated(Normal(); lower=m)\n    return (m=m, x=x)\nend\n\ndemo_dynamic_constraint (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nHere, m is distributed according to a plain Normal(), whereas the variable x is constrained to be in the domain (m, Inf). Because of this, we expect that any time we sample from the model, we should have that m &lt; x (in terms of their model representations):\n\nmodel = demo_dynamic_constraint()\nvi = VarInfo(model)\nvn_m, vn_x = @varname(m), @varname(x)\n\nvi[vn_m], vi[vn_x]\n\n(-0.1363671801604851, 0.07028870940645648)\n\n\n(Note that vi[vn] is a shorthand for getindex(vi, vn), so this retrieves the model representations of m and x.) So far, so good. Let’s now link this VarInfo so that we end up working in an ‘unconstrained’ space, where both m and x can take on any values in (-Inf, Inf). First, we should check that the model representations are unchanged when linking:\n\nvi_linked = link(vi, model)\nvi_linked[vn_m], vi_linked[vn_x]\n\n(-0.1363671801604851, 0.07028870940645648)\n\n\nBut if we change the value of m, to, say, a bit larger than x:\n\n# Update the model representation for `m` in `vi_linked`.\nvi_linked[vn_m] = vi_linked[vn_x] + 1\nvi_linked[vn_m], vi_linked[vn_x]\n\n(1.0702887094064564, 0.07028870940645648)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis is just for demonstration purposes! You shouldn’t be directly setting variables in a linked varinfo like this unless you know for a fact that the value will be compatible with the constraints of the model.\n\n\nNow, we see that the constraint m &lt; x is no longer satisfied. Hence, one might expect that if we try to evaluate the model using this VarInfo, we should obtain an error. Here, evaluate!! returns two things: the model’s return value itself (which we defined above to be a NamedTuple), and the resulting VarInfo post-evaluation.\n\nretval, ret_varinfo = DynamicPPL.evaluate!!(model, vi_linked)\ngetlogp(ret_varinfo)\n\n(logprior = -1.2757232284815625, logjac = 1.5767002382275592, loglikelihood = 0.0)\n\n\nBut we don’t get any errors! Indeed, we could even calculate the ‘log probability density’ for this evaluation.\nTo understand this, we need to look at the actual value which was used during the model evaluation. We can glean this from the return value (or from the returned VarInfo, but the former is easier):\n\nretval\n\n(m = 1.0702887094064564, x = 1.2769445989733978)\n\n\nWe can see here that the model evaluation used the value of m that we provided, but the value of x was ‘updated’.\nThe reason for this is that internally in a model evaluation, we construct the transformation function from the internal to the model representation based on the current realizations in the model! That is, we take the dist in a x ~ dist expression at model evaluation time and use that to construct the transformation, thus allowing it to change between model evaluations without invalidating the transformation.\nKnowing that the distribution of x depends on the value of m, we can now understand how the model representation of x got updated. The linked VarInfo does not store the model representation of x, but only its linked internal representation. So, what happened during the model evaluation above was that the linked internal representation of x – which was constructed using the original value of m – was transformed back into a new model representation using a different value of m.\nWe can reproduce the ‘new’ value of x by performing these transformations manually:\n\n# Generate a fresh linked VarInfo (without the new / 'corrupted' values)\nvi_linked = link(vi, model)\n# See the linked internal representations\nDynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi_linked, vn_m), DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi_linked, vn_x)\n\n([-0.1363671801604851], [-1.5767002382275592])\n\n\nNow we update the value of m like we did before:\n\nvi_linked[vn_m] = vi_linked[vn_x] + 1\nvi_linked[vn_m]\n\n1.0702887094064564\n\n\nWhen evaluating the model, the distribution of x is now changed, and so is the corresponding inverse bijector:\n\nnew_dist_x = truncated(Normal(); lower=vi_linked[vn_m])\nnew_f_inv = DynamicPPL.invlink_transform(new_dist_x)\n\nBijectors.Inverse{Bijectors.TruncatedBijector{Float64, Float64}}(Bijectors.TruncatedBijector{Float64, Float64}(1.0702887094064564, Inf))\n\n\nand if we apply this to the internal representation of x:\n\nnew_f_inv(DynamicPPL.getindex_internal(vi_linked, vn_x))\n\n1-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.2769445989733978\n\n\nwhich is the same value as we got above in retval.",

    "text": "Turing is an open-source project and is hosted on GitHub. We welcome contributions from the community in all forms large or small: bug reports, feature implementations, code contributions, or improvements to documentation or infrastructure are all extremely valuable. We would also very much appreciate examples of models written using Turing.\n\nHow to get involved\nOur outstanding issues are tabulated on our issue tracker. Closing one of these may involve implementing new features, fixing bugs, or writing example models.\nYou can also join the #turing channel on the Julia Slack and say hello!\nIf you are new to open source software, please see GitHub’s introduction or Julia’s contribution guide on using version control for collaboration.\n\n\nDocumentation\nEach of the packages in the Turing ecosystem (see Libraries) has its own documentation, which is typically found in the docs folder of the corresponding package. For example, the source code for DynamicPPL’s documentation can be found in its repository.\nThe documentation for Turing.jl itself consists of the tutorials that you see on this website, and is built from the separate docs repository. None of the documentation is generated from the main Turing.jl repository; in particular, the API that Turing exports does not currently form part of the documentation.\nOther sections of the website (anything that isn’t a package, or a tutorial) – for example, the list of libraries – is built from the turinglang.github.io repository.\n\n\nTests\nTuring, like most software libraries, has a test suite. You can run the whole suite by running julia --project=. from the root of the Turing repository, and then running\nimport Pkg; Pkg.test(\"Turing\")\nThe test suite subdivides into files in the test folder, and you can run only some of them using commands like\nimport Pkg; Pkg.test(\"Turing\"; test_args=[\"optim\", \"hmc\", \"--skip\", \"ext\"])\nThis one would run all files with “optim” or “hmc” in their path, such as test/optimisation/Optimisation.jl, but not files with “ext” in their path. Alternatively, you can set these arguments as command line arguments when you run Julia\njulia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.test(; test_args=ARGS)' -- optim hmc --skip ext\nAlternatively, set the global ARGS variable, and call include(\"test/runtests.jl\").\n\n\nPull requests, versions, and releases\nWe merge all code changes through pull requests on GitHub. To make a contribution to one of the Turing packages, fork it on GitHub, start a new branch on your fork, and add commits to it. Once you’re done, open a pull request to the main repository under TuringLang. Someone from the dev team will review your code (if they don’t, ping @TuringLang/maintainers in a comment to get their attention) and check that the continuous integration tests pass (with some allowed exceptions, see below). If all looks good, we’ll merge your PR with gratitude. If not, we’ll help you fix it and then merge it with gratitude.\nEverything in this section about pull requests and branches applies to the Turing.jl and DynamicPPL.jl repositories. Most of it also applies to other repositories under the TuringLang ecosystem, though some do not bother with the main/breaking distinction or with a HISTORY.md. As at August 2025 we are slowly moving towards having all repos do the full process, so a new HISTORY.md in a repo that doesn’t yet have one is always welcome.\n\nBranches\nLike Julia packages generally, Turing.jl follows semantic versioning. Because of this, we have two persistently alive branches in our repository: main and breaking. All code that gets released as a new version of Turing gets merged into main, and a release is made from there. However, any breaking changes should first be merged into breaking. breaking will then periodically be merged into main.\nThe idea is that breaking always contains commits that build towards the next breaking release in the semantic versioning sense. That is, if the changes you make might break or change the behaviour of correctly written code that uses Turing.jl, your PR should target the breaking branch, and your code should be merged into breaking. If your changes cause no such breakage for users, your PR should target main. Notably, any bug fixes should merge directly into main.\nThis way we can frequently release new patch version from main, while developing breaking changes in parallel on breaking. E.g. if the current version is 0.19.3, and someone fixes a bug, we can merge the fix into main and release it as 0.19.4. Meanwhile, breaking changes can be developed and merged into breaking, which is building towards a release of 0.20.0. Multiple breaking changes may be accumulated into breaking, before finally the breaking-to-main merge is done, and 0.20.0 is released. On breaking the version number should then immediately be bumped to 0.21.\nWe do not generally backport bug fixes, although we may consider doing so in special circumstances.\n\n\nChange history\nWe keep a cumulative changelog in a file called HISTORY.md at the root of the repository. It should have an entry for every new breaking release, explaining everything our users need to know about the changes, such as what may have broken and how to fix things to work with the new version. Any major new features should also be described in HISTORY.md, as may any other changes that are useful for users to know about. Bug fixes generally don’t need an entry in HISTORY.md. Any new breaking release must have an entry in HISTORY.md, entries for non-breaking releases are optional.\n\n\nContinuous integration (CI) tests\nWe generally run the whole test suite of each repository in a GitHub action, typically for a few different versions of Julia, including the earliest supported version and the latest stable release. On some repositories we also run a few other checks in CI, such as code formatting and simple benchmarks. Generally all tests except those run on a prerelease version of Julia (e.g. a release candidate of an upcoming Julia release), and all code formatting checks, should pass before merging a PR. Exceptions can be made if the cause of the failure is known and unrelated to the PR. CI checks other than tests and formatting serve various purposes, and some of them can be allowed to fail. Some examples are\n\nAnything running on a prerelease of Julia. These inform us of trouble ahead when that prerelease becomes an actual release, but don’t require fixing for a PR to be merged.\nAny code coverage checks. Code coverage numbers can be helpful in catching missing tests or cases where the tests don’t test what they are intended to. However, we do not insist on any particular coverage figures, since they are not a very good metric of a test suite’s extensiveness.\nThe benchmarks on DynamicPPL repo. These should be investigated to understand why they fail. If the reason is a bug in the PR, an actual test should be added to the test suite to catch it. However, sometimes they fail for unrelated reasons.\nOccasionally CI failures are caused by bugs that require upstream fixes (such as for AD backends, or base Julia). Please ping a maintainer if you are unsure if this is the case. A good indicator for this is if the same test is failing on the base branch of your pull request.\nThe CI check in the docs repo for whether the docs are built with the latest Turing.jl release. This test failing is a reminder that we should make a PR to update to the latest version, but does not need fixing when working on a PR that makes unrelated changes to the documentation.\n\nIf you are ever unsure whether some CI check needs to pass, or if the reason why one is failing is mysterious or seems unrelated to the PR, ask a maintainer and they’ll help you out.\n\n\nPlease make mistakes\nGetting pull requests from outside the core developer team is one of the greatest joys of open source maintenance, and Turing’s community of contributors is its greatest asset. If you are thinking of contributing, please do open a pull request, even an imperfect or half-finished one, or an issue to discuss it first if you prefer. You don’t need to nail all of the above details on the first go, the dev team is very happy to help you figure out how to bump version numbers or whether you need to target main or breaking.\n\n\nFor Turing.jl core developers\nIf you are a core developer of TuringLang, two notes, in addition to the above, apply:\n\nYou don’t need to make your own fork of the package you are editing. Just make a new branch on the main repository, usually named your-username/change-you-are-making (we don’t strictly enforce this convention though). You should definitely still make a branch and a PR, and never push directly to main or breaking.\nYou can make a release of the package after your work is merged into main. This is done by leaving a comment on the latest commit on main, saying\n\n@JuliaRegistrator register\n\nRelease notes:\n[YOUR RELEASE NOTES HERE]\nIf you are making a breaking release, your release notes must also contain the string Breaking changes somewhere in them (this is mandated by the @JuliaRegistrator bot, described below).\nThe @JuliaRegistrator bot will handle creating a pull request into the Julia central package repository and tagging a new release in the repository. The release notes should be a copy-paste of the notes written in HISTORY.md if such an entry exists, or otherwise (for a patch release) a short summary of changes.\nEven core devs should always merge all their code through pull requests into main or breaking. All code should generally be reviewed by another core developer and pass continuous integration (CI) checks. Exceptions can be made in some cases though, such as ignoring failing CI checks where the cause is known and not due to the current pull request, or skipping code review when the pull request author is an experienced developer of the package and the changes are trivial.\n\n\n\nCode Formatting\nTuring uses JuliaFormatter.jl to ensure consistent code style across the codebase. All code must be formatted before submitting a pull request, and ideally with every commit.\n\nInstalling JuliaFormatter\nWe use version 1 of JuliaFormatter. Install it in your global Julia environment (not the project environment, as adding it to the Project.toml would make it an invalid dependency of the project):\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(name=\"JuliaFormatter\", version=\"1\"); Pkg.pin(\"JuliaFormatter\")'\n\n\nFormatting Code\nTo format all Julia files in the current directory and subdirectories:\njulia -e 'using JuliaFormatter; format(\".\")'\nRun this command from the root of the repository before committing your changes. This ensures your code follows the project’s formatting standards and maintains consistency across the codebase.\n\n\n\nStyle Guide\nTuring has a style guide, described below. Reviewing it before making a pull request is not strictly necessary, but you may be asked to change portions of your code to conform with the style guide before it is merged.\nMost Turing code follows Blue: a Style Guide for Julia. These conventions were created from a variety of sources including Python’s PEP8, Julia’s Notes for Contributors, and Julia’s Style Guide.\n\nSynopsis\n\nUse 4 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.\nTry to adhere to a 92 character line length limit.\nUse upper camel case convention for modules and types.\nUse lower case with underscores for method names (note: Julia code likes to use lower case without underscores).\nComments are good, try to explain the intentions of the code.\nUse whitespace to make the code more readable.\nNo whitespace at the end of a line (trailing whitespace).\nAvoid padding brackets with spaces. ex. Int64(value) preferred over Int64( value ).\n\n\n\nA Word on Consistency\nWhen adhering to the Blue style, it’s important to realize that these are guidelines, not rules. This is stated best in the PEP8:\n\nA style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is most important.\n\n\nBut most importantly: know when to be inconsistent – sometimes the style guide just doesn’t apply. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

As explained in the interface guide, building a sampling method that can be used by sample consists in overloading the structs and functions in AbstractMCMC. The interface guide also gives a standalone example of their implementation, AdvancedMH.jl.\nTuring sampling methods (most of which are written here) also implement AbstractMCMC. Turing defines a particular architecture for AbstractMCMC implementations, that enables working with models defined by the @model macro, and uses DynamicPPL as a backend. The goal of this page is to describe this architecture, and how you would go about implementing your own sampling method in Turing, using Importance Sampling as an example. I don’t go into all the details: for instance, I don’t address selectors or parallelism.\nFirst, we explain how Importance Sampling works in the abstract. Consider the model defined in the first code block. Mathematically, it can be written:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ns &\\sim \\text{InverseGamma}(2, 3), \\\\\nm &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sqrt{s}), \\\\\nx &\\sim \\text{Normal}(m, \\sqrt{s}), \\\\\ny &\\sim \\text{Normal}(m, \\sqrt{s}).\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe latent variables are \\(s\\) and \\(m\\), the observed variables are \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The model joint distribution \\(p(s,m,x,y)\\) decomposes into the prior \\(p(s,m)\\) and the likelihood \\(p(x,y \\mid s,m).\\) Since \\(x = 1.5\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are observed, the goal is to infer the posterior distribution \\(p(s,m \\mid x,y).\\)\nImportance Sampling produces independent samples \\((s_i, m_i)\\) from the prior distribution. It also outputs unnormalized weights\n\\[\nw_i = \\frac {p(x,y,s_i,m_i)} {p(s_i, m_i)} = p(x,y \\mid s_i, m_i)\n\\]\nsuch that the empirical distribution\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i =1}^N \\frac {w_i} {\\sum_{j=1}^N w_j} \\delta_{(s_i, m_i)}\n\\]\nis a good approximation of the posterior."

Define a Sampler\nRecall the last line of the above code block:\n\nchn = sample(mod, alg, n_samples, progress=false)\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×5×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nLog evidence      = -3.70175351316498\nIterations        = 1:1:1000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 0.04 seconds\nCompute duration  = 0.04 seconds\nparameters        = s², m\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nHere sample takes as arguments a model mod, an algorithm alg, and a number of samples n_samples, and returns an instance chn of Chains which can be analysed using the functions in MCMCChains.\n\nModels\nTo define a model, you declare a joint distribution on variables in the @model macro, and specify which variables are observed and which should be inferred, as well as the value of the observed variables. Thus, when implementing Importance Sampling,\n\nmod = gdemo(1.5, 2)\n\nDynamicPPL.Model{typeof(gdemo), (:x, :y), (), (), Tuple{Float64, Int64}, Tuple{}, DynamicPPL.DefaultContext}(gdemo, (x = 1.5, y = 2), NamedTuple(), DynamicPPL.DefaultContext())\n\n\ncreates an instance mod of the struct Model, which corresponds to the observations of a value of 1.5 for x, and a value of 2 for y.\nThis is all handled by DynamicPPL, more specifically here. I will return to how models are used to inform sampling algorithms below.\n\n\nAlgorithms\nAn algorithm is just a sampling method: in Turing, it is a subtype of the abstract type InferenceAlgorithm. Defining an algorithm may require specifying a few high-level parameters. For example, “Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo” may be too vague, but “Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with 10 leapfrog steps per proposal and a stepsize of 0.01” is an algorithm. “Metropolis-Hastings” may be too vague, but “Metropolis-Hastings with proposal distribution p” is an algorithm. Thus\n\nstepsize = 0.01\nL = 10\nalg = HMC(stepsize, L)\n\nHMC{AutoForwardDiff{nothing, Nothing}, AdvancedHMC.UnitEuclideanMetric}(0.01, 10, AutoForwardDiff())\n\n\ndefines a Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo algorithm, an instance of HMC, which is a subtype of InferenceAlgorithm.\nIn the case of Importance Sampling, there is no need to specify additional parameters:\n\nalg = IS()\n\nIS()\n\n\ndefines an Importance Sampling algorithm, an instance of IS, a subtype of InferenceAlgorithm.\nWhen creating your own Turing sampling method, you must, therefore, build a subtype of InferenceAlgorithm corresponding to your method.\n\n\nSamplers\nSamplers are not the same as algorithms. An algorithm is a generic sampling method, a sampler is an object that stores information about how algorithm and model interact during sampling, and is modified as sampling progresses. The Sampler struct is defined in DynamicPPL.\nTuring implements AbstractMCMC’s AbstractSampler with the Sampler struct defined in DynamicPPL. The most important attributes of an instance spl of Sampler are:\n\nspl.alg: the sampling method used, an instance of a subtype of InferenceAlgorithm\nspl.state: information about the sampling process, see below\n\nWhen you call sample(mod, alg, n_samples), Turing first uses model and alg to build an instance spl of Sampler , then calls the native AbstractMCMC function sample(mod, spl, n_samples).\nWhen you define your own Turing sampling method, you must therefore build:\n\na sampler constructor that uses a model and an algorithm to initialize an instance of Sampler. For Importance Sampling:\n\n\nfunction Sampler(alg::IS, model::Model, s::Selector)\n    info = Dict{Symbol,Any}()\n    state = ISState(model)\n    return Sampler(alg, info, s, state)\nend\n\n\na state struct implementing AbstractSamplerState corresponding to your method: we cover this in the following paragraph.\n\n\n\nStates\nThe vi field contains all the important information about sampling: first and foremost, the values of all the samples, but also the distributions from which they are sampled, the names of model parameters, and other metadata. As we will see below, many important steps during sampling correspond to queries or updates to spl.state.vi.\nBy default, you can use SamplerState, a concrete type defined in inference/Inference.jl, which extends AbstractSamplerState and has no field except for vi:\n\nmutable struct SamplerState{VIType&lt;:VarInfo} &lt;: AbstractSamplerState\n    vi::VIType\nend\n\nWhen doing Importance Sampling, we care not only about the values of the samples but also their weights. We will see below that the weight of each sample is also added to spl.state.vi. Moreover, the average\n\\[\n\\frac 1 N \\sum_{j=1}^N w_i = \\frac 1 N \\sum_{j=1}^N p(x,y \\mid s_i, m_i)\n\\]\nof the sample weights is a particularly important quantity:\n\nit is used to normalize the empirical approximation of the posterior distribution\nits logarithm is the importance sampling estimate of the log evidence \\(\\log p(x, y)\\)\n\nTo avoid having to compute it over and over again, is.jldefines an IS-specific concrete type ISState for sampler states, with an additional field final_logevidence containing\n\\[\n\\log \\frac 1 N \\sum_{j=1}^N w_i.\n\\]\n\nmutable struct ISState{V&lt;:VarInfo,F&lt;:AbstractFloat} &lt;: AbstractSamplerState\n    vi::V\n    final_logevidence::F\nend\n\n# additional constructor\nISState(model::Model) = ISState(VarInfo(model), 0.0)\n\nThe following diagram summarizes the hierarchy presented above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\nspl\n\nspl\nSampler\n&lt;:AbstractSampler\n\n\n\nstate\n\nspl.state\nState\n&lt;:AbstractSamplerState\n\n\n\nspl-&gt;state\n\n\n\n\n\nalg\n\nspl.alg\nAlgorithm\n&lt;:InferenceAlgorithm\n\n\n\nspl-&gt;alg\n\n\n\n\n\nplaceholder1\n\n...\n\n\n\nspl-&gt;placeholder1\n\n\n\n\n\nvi\n\nspl.state.vi\nVarInfo\n&lt;:AbstractVarInfo\n\n\n\nstate-&gt;vi\n\n\n\n\n\nplaceholder2\n\n...\n\n\n\nstate-&gt;placeholder2\n\n\n\n\n\nplaceholder3\n\n...\n\n\n\nalg-&gt;placeholder3\n\n\n\n\n\nplaceholder4\n\n...\n\n\n\nplaceholder1-&gt;placeholder4"

    "text": "2. Overload the functions used inside mcmcsample\nA lot of the things here are method-specific. However, Turing also has some functions that make it easier for you to implement these functions, for example.\n\nTransitions\nAbstractMCMC stores information corresponding to each individual sample in objects called transition, but does not specify what the structure of these objects could be. You could decide to implement a type MyTransition for transitions corresponding to the specifics of your methods. However, there are many situations in which the only information you need for each sample is:\n\nits value: \\(\\theta\\)\nlog of the joint probability of the observed data and this sample: lp\n\nInference.jl defines a struct Transition, which corresponds to this default situation\n\nstruct Transition{T,F&lt;:AbstractFloat}\n    θ::T\n    lp::F\nend\n\nIt also contains a constructor that builds an instance of Transition from an instance spl of Sampler: \\(\\theta\\) is spl.state.vi converted to a namedtuple, and lp is getlogp(spl.state.vi). is.jl uses this default constructor at the end of the step! function here.\n\n\nHow sample works\nA crude summary, which ignores things like parallelism, is the following:\nsample calls mcmcsample, which calls\n\nsample_init! to set things up\nstep! repeatedly to produce multiple new transitions\nsample_end! to perform operations once all samples have been obtained\nbundle_samples to convert a vector of transitions into a more palatable type, for instance a Chain.\n\nYou can, of course, implement all of these functions, but AbstractMCMC as well as Turing, also provide default implementations for simple cases. For instance, importance sampling uses the default implementations of sample_init! and bundle_samples, which is why you don’t see code for them inside is.jl."

    "section": "3. Overload assume and observe",
    "text": "3. Overload assume and observe\nThe functions mentioned above, such as sample_init!, step!, etc., must, of course, use information about the model in order to generate samples! In particular, these functions may need samples from distributions defined in the model or to evaluate the density of these distributions at some values of the corresponding parameters or observations.\nFor an example of the former, consider Importance Sampling as defined in is.jl. This implementation of Importance Sampling uses the model prior distribution as a proposal distribution, and therefore requires samples from the prior distribution of the model. Another example is Approximate Bayesian Computation, which requires multiple samples from the model prior and likelihood distributions in order to generate a single sample.\nAn example of the latter is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. At every step of sampling from a target posterior\n\\[\np(\\theta \\mid x_{\\text{obs}}),\n\\]\nin order to compute the acceptance ratio, you need to evaluate the model joint density\n\\[\np\\left(\\theta_{\\text{prop}}, x_{\\text{obs}}\\right)\n\\]\nwith \\(\\theta_{\\text{prop}}\\) a sample from the proposal and \\(x_{\\text{obs}}\\) the observed data.\nThis begs the question: how can these functions access model information during sampling? Recall that the model is stored as an instance m of Model. One of the attributes of m is the model evaluation function m.f, which is built by compiling the @model macro. Executing f runs the tilde statements of the model in order, and adds model information to the sampler (the instance of Sampler that stores information about the ongoing sampling process) at each step (see here for more information about how the @model macro is compiled). The DynamicPPL functions assume and observe determine what kind of information to add to the sampler for every tilde statement.\nConsider an instance m of Model and a sampler spl, with associated VarInfo vi = spl.state.vi. At some point during the sampling process, an AbstractMCMC function such as step! calls m(vi, ...), which calls the model evaluation function m.f(vi, ...).\n\nfor every tilde statement in the @model macro, m.f(vi, ...) returns model-related information (samples, value of the model density, etc.), and adds it to vi. How does it do that?\n\nrecall that the code for m.f(vi, ...) is automatically generated by compilation of the @model macro\nfor every tilde statement in the @model declaration, this code contains a call to assume(vi, ...) if the variable on the LHS of the tilde is a model parameter to infer, and observe(vi, ...) if the variable on the LHS of the tilde is an observation\nin the file corresponding to your sampling method (ie in Turing.jl/src/inference/&lt;your_method&gt;.jl), you have overloaded assume and observe, so that they can modify vi to include the information and samples that you care about!\nat a minimum, assume and observe return the log density lp of the sample or observation. the model evaluation function then immediately calls acclogp!!(vi, lp), which adds lp to the value of the log joint density stored in vi.\n\n\nHere’s what assume looks like for Importance Sampling:\n\nfunction DynamicPPL.assume(rng, spl::Sampler{&lt;:IS}, dist::Distribution, vn::VarName, vi)\n    r = rand(rng, dist)\n    push!(vi, vn, r, dist, spl)\n    return r, 0\nend\n\nThe function first generates a sample r from the distribution dist (the right hand side of the tilde statement). It then adds r to vi, and returns r and 0.\nThe observe function is even simpler:\n\nfunction DynamicPPL.observe(spl::Sampler{&lt;:IS}, dist::Distribution, value, vi)\n    return logpdf(dist, value)\nend\n\nIt simply returns the density (in the discrete case, the probability) of the observed value under the distribution dist."

There is the method LogDensityProblems.logdensity_and_gradient which should return a 2-tuple where the first entry is the evaluation of the logdensity \\(\\log \\gamma(x)\\) and the second entry is the gradient \\(\\nabla \\log \\gamma(x)\\).\nThere are two ways to “implement” this method: 1) we implement it by hand, which is feasible in the case of our IsotropicNormalModel, or b) we defer the implementation of this to a automatic differentiation backend.\nTo implement it by hand we can simply do\n\n# Tell LogDensityProblems.jl that first-order, i.e. gradient information, is available.\nLogDensityProblems.capabilities(model::IsotropicNormalModel) = LogDensityProblems.LogDensityOrder{1}()\n\n# Implement `logdensity_and_gradient`.\nfunction LogDensityProblems.logdensity_and_gradient(model::IsotropicNormalModel, x)\n    logγ_x = LogDensityProblems.logdensity(model, x)\n    ∇logγ_x = -x .* (x - model.mean)\n    return logγ_x, ∇logγ_x\nend\n\nLet’s just try it out:\n\n# Instantiate the problem.\nmodel = IsotropicNormalModel([-5., 0., 5.])\n# Create some example input that we can test on.\nx_example = randn(LogDensityProblems.dimension(model))\n# Evaluate!\nLogDensityProblems.logdensity(model, x_example)\n\n-37.22471855825014\n\n\nTo defer it to an automatic differentiation backend, we can do\n\n# Tell LogDensityProblems.jl we only have access to 0-th order information.\nLogDensityProblems.capabilities(model::IsotropicNormalModel) = LogDensityProblems.LogDensityOrder{0}()\n\n# Use `LogDensityProblemsAD`'s `ADgradient` in combination with some AD backend to implement `logdensity_and_gradient`.\nusing LogDensityProblemsAD, ADTypes, ForwardDiff\nmodel_with_grad = ADgradient(AutoForwardDiff(), model)\nLogDensityProblems.logdensity(model_with_grad, x_example)\n\n-37.22471855825014\n\n\nWe’ll continue with the second approach in this tutorial since this is typically what one does in practice, because there are better hobbies to spend time on than deriving gradients by hand.\nAt this point, one might wonder how we’re going to tie this back to Turing.jl in the end. Effectively, when working with inference methods that only require log-density evaluations and / or higher-order information of the log-density, Turing.jl actually converts the user-provided Model into an object implementing the above methods for LogDensityProblems.jl. As a result, most samplers provided by Turing.jl are actually implemented to work with LogDensityProblems.jl, enabling their use both within Turing.jl and outside of Turing.jl! Morever, there exists similar conversions for Stan through BridgeStan and StanLogDensityProblems.jl, which means that a sampler supporting the LogDensityProblems.jl interface can easily be used on both Turing.jl and Stan models (in addition to user-provided models, as our IsotropicNormalModel above)!\nAnyways, let’s move on to actually implementing the sampler.",

    "text": "Implementing MALA in AbstractMCMC.jl\nNow that we’ve established that a model implementing the LogDensityProblems.jl interface provides us with all the information we need from \\(\\log \\gamma(x)\\), we can address the question: given an object that implements the LogDensityProblems.jl interface, how can we define a sampler for it?\nWe’re going to do this by making our sampler a sub-type of AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler in addition to implementing a few methods from AbstractMCMC.jl. Why? Because it gets us a lot of functionality for free, as we will see later.\nMoreover, AbstractMCMC.jl provides a very natural interface for MCMC algorithms.\nFirst, we’ll define our MALA type\n\nusing AbstractMCMC\n\nstruct MALA{T,A} &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler\n    \"stepsize used in the leapfrog step\"\n    ϵ_init::T\n    \"covariance matrix used for the momentum\"\n    M_init::A\nend\n\nNotice how we’ve added the suffix _init to both the stepsize and the covariance matrix. We’ve done this because a AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler should be immutable. Of course there might be many scenarios where we want to allow something like the stepsize and / or the covariance matrix to vary between iterations, e.g. during the burn-in / adaptation phase of the sampling process we might want to adjust the parameters using statistics computed from these initial iterations. But information which can change between iterations should not go in the sampler itself! Instead, this information should go in the sampler state.\nThe sampler state should at the very least contain all the necessary information to perform the next MCMC iteration, but usually contains further information, e.g. quantities and statistics useful for evaluating whether the sampler has converged.\nWe will use the following sampler state for our MALA sampler:\n\nstruct MALAState{A&lt;:AbstractVector{&lt;:Real}}\n    \"current position\"\n    x::A\nend\n\nThis might seem overly redundant: we’re defining a type MALAState and it only contains a simple vector of reals. In this particular case we indeed could have dropped this and simply used a AbstractVector{&lt;:Real} as our sampler state, but typically, as we will see later, one wants to include other quantities in the sampler state. For example, if we also wanted to adapt the parameters of our MALA, e.g. alter the stepsize depending on acceptance rates, in which case we should also put ϵ in the state, but for now we’ll keep things simple.\nMoreover, we also want a sample type, which is a type meant for “public consumption”, i.e. the end-user. This is generally going to contain a subset of the information present in the state. But in such a simple scenario as this, we similarly only have a AbstractVector{&lt;:Real}:\n\nstruct MALASample{A&lt;:AbstractVector{&lt;:Real}}\n    \"current position\"\n    x::A\nend\n\nWe currently have three things:\n\nA AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler implementation called MALA.\nA state MALAState for our sampler MALA.\nA sample MALASample for our sampler MALA.\n\nThat means that we’re ready to implement the only thing that really matters: AbstractMCMC.step.\nAbstractMCMC.step defines the MCMC iteration of our MALA given the current MALAState. Specifically, the signature of the function is as follows:\n\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    # The RNG to ensure reproducibility.\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    # The model that defines our target.\n    model::AbstractMCMC.AbstractModel,\n    # The sampler for which we're taking a `step`.\n    sampler::AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler,\n    # The current sampler `state`.\n    state;\n    # Additional keyword arguments that we may or may not need.\n    kwargs...\n)\n\nMoreover, there is a specific AbstractMCMC.AbstractModel which is used to indicate that the model that is provided implements the LogDensityProblems.jl interface: AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel.\nSince, as we discussed earlier, in our case we’re indeed going to work with types that support the LogDensityProblems.jl interface, we’ll define AbstractMCMC.step for such a AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel.\nNote that AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel has no other purpose; it has a single field called logdensity, and it does nothing else. But by wrapping the model in AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel, it allows samplers that want to work with LogDensityProblems.jl to define their AbstractMCMC.step on this type without running into method ambiguities.\nAll in all, that means that the signature for our AbstractMCMC.step is going to be the following:\n\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    # `LogDensityModel` so we know we're working with LogDensityProblems.jl model.\n    model::AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel,\n    # Our sampler.\n    sampler::MALA,\n    # Our sampler state.\n    state::MALAState;\n    kwargs...\n)\n\nGreat! Now let’s actually implement the full AbstractMCMC.step for our MALA.\nLet’s remind ourselves what we’re going to do:\n\nSample a new momentum \\(p\\).\nCompute the log-density of the extended target \\(\\log \\bar{\\gamma}(x, p)\\).\nTake a single leapfrog step \\((\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p}) = L_{\\epsilon}(x, p)\\).\nAccept or reject the proposed \\((\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p})\\).\n\nAll in all, this results in the following:\n\nusing Random: Random\nusing Distributions  # so we get the `MvNormal`\n\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    model_wrapper::AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel,\n    sampler::MALA,\n    state::MALAState;\n    kwargs...\n)\n    # Extract the wrapped model which implements LogDensityProblems.jl.\n    model = model_wrapper.logdensity\n    # Let's just extract the sampler parameters to make our lives easier.\n    ϵ = sampler.ϵ_init\n    M = sampler.M_init\n    # Extract the current parameters.\n    x = state.x\n    # Sample the momentum.\n    p_dist = MvNormal(zeros(LogDensityProblems.dimension(model)), M)\n    p = rand(rng, p_dist)\n    # Propose using a single leapfrog step.\n    x̃, p̃ = leapfrog_step(model, x, p, ϵ, M)\n    # Accept or reject proposal.\n    logp = LogDensityProblems.logdensity(model, x) + logpdf(p_dist, p)\n    logp̃ = LogDensityProblems.logdensity(model, x̃) + logpdf(p_dist, p̃)\n    logα = logp̃ - logp\n    state_new = if log(rand(rng)) &lt; logα\n        # Accept.\n        MALAState(x̃)\n    else\n        # Reject.\n        MALAState(x)\n    end\n    # Return the \"sample\" and the sampler state.\n    return MALASample(state_new.x), state_new\nend\n\nFairly straight-forward.\nOf course, we haven’t defined the leapfrog_step method yet, so let’s do that:\n\nfunction leapfrog_step(model, x, p, ϵ, M)\n    # Update momentum `p` using \"position\" `x`.\n    ∇logγ_x = last(LogDensityProblems.logdensity_and_gradient(model, x))\n    p1 = p + (ϵ / 2) .* ∇logγ_x\n    # Update the \"position\" `x` using momentum `p1`.\n    x̃ = x + ϵ .* (M \\ p1)\n    # Update momentum `p1` using position `x̃`\n    ∇logγ_x̃ = last(LogDensityProblems.logdensity_and_gradient(model, x̃))\n    p2 = p1 + (ϵ / 2) .* ∇logγ_x̃\n    # Flip momentum `p2`.\n    p̃ = -p2\n    return x̃, p̃\nend\n\nleapfrog_step (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWith all of this, we’re technically ready to sample!\n\nusing Random, LinearAlgebra\n\nrng = Random.default_rng()\nsampler = MALA(1, I)\nstate = MALAState(zeros(LogDensityProblems.dimension(model)))\n\nx_next, state_next = AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng,\n    AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel(model),\n    sampler,\n    state\n)\n\n(MALASample{Vector{Float64}}([0.09385774516363804, 0.24019928604962307, 0.21333316190260695]), MALAState{Vector{Float64}}([0.09385774516363804, 0.24019928604962307, 0.21333316190260695]))\n\n\nGreat, it works!\nAnd I promised we would get quite some functionality for free if we implemented AbstractMCMC.step, and so we can now simply call sample to perform standard MCMC sampling:\n\n# Perform 1000 iterations with our `MALA` sampler.\nsamples = sample(model_with_grad, sampler, 10_000; initial_state=state, progress=false)\n# Concatenate into a matrix.\nsamples_matrix = stack(sample -&gt; sample.x, samples)\n\n3×10000 Matrix{Float64}:\n -3.85092   -3.93938   -3.93938   …  -6.44061  -6.18355  -7.13546\n -0.629853   0.629348   0.629348     -1.09214  -1.78413  -1.79617\n  2.90226    3.91692    3.91692       6.31429   6.38549   5.55343\n\n\n\n# Compute the marginal means and standard deviations.\nhcat(mean(samples_matrix; dims=2), std(samples_matrix; dims=2))\n\n3×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n -4.99324     1.00094\n  0.00170622  0.998395\n  4.98183     0.996222\n\n\nLet’s visualize the samples\n\nusing StatsPlots\nplot(transpose(samples_matrix[:, 1:10:end]), alpha=0.5, legend=false)\n\n\n\n\nLook at that!

    "text": "Using our sampler with Turing.jl\nAs we promised, all of this hassle of implementing our MALA sampler in a way that uses LogDensityProblems.jl and AbstractMCMC.jl gets us something more than just an “automatic” implementation of AbstractMCMC.sample.\nIt also enables use with Turing.jl through the externalsampler, but we need to do one final thing first: we need to tell Turing.jl how to extract a vector of parameters from the “sample” returned in our implementation of AbstractMCMC.step. In our case, the “sample” is a MALASample, so we just need the following line:\n\nusing Turing\nusing DynamicPPL\n\n# Overload the `getparams` method for our \"sample\" type, which is just a vector.\nTuring.Inference.getparams(::DynamicPPL.Model, sample::MALASample) = sample.x\n\nAnd with that, we’re good to go!\n\n# Our previous model defined as a Turing.jl model.\n@model mvnormal_model() = x ~ MvNormal([-5., 0., 5.], I)\n# Instantiate our model.\nturing_model = mvnormal_model()\n# Call `sample` but now we're passing in a Turing.jl `model` and wrapping\n# our `MALA` sampler in the `externalsampler` to tell Turing.jl that the sampler\n# expects something that implements LogDensityProblems.jl.\nchain = sample(turing_model, externalsampler(sampler), 10_000; progress=false)\n\nChains MCMC chain (10000×6×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:10000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 10000\nWall duration     = 3.45 seconds\nCompute duration  = 3.45 seconds\nparameters        = x[1], x[2], x[3]\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nPretty neat, eh?\n\nModels with constrained parameters\nOne thing we’ve sort of glossed over in all of the above is that MALA, at least how we’ve implemented it, requires \\(x\\) to live in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) for some \\(d &gt; 0\\). If some of the parameters were in fact constrained, e.g. we were working with a Beta distribution which has support on the interval \\((0, 1)\\), not on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\), we could easily end up outside of the valid range \\((0, 1)\\).\n\n@model beta_model() = x ~ Beta(3, 3)\nturing_model = beta_model()\nchain = sample(turing_model, externalsampler(sampler), 10_000; progress=false)\n\nChains MCMC chain (10000×4×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:10000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 10000\nWall duration     = 2.05 seconds\nCompute duration  = 2.05 seconds\nparameters        = x\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nYep, that still works, but only because Turing.jl actually transforms the turing_model from constrained to unconstrained, so that the sampler provided to externalsampler is actually always working in unconstrained space! This is not always desirable, so we can turn this off:\n\nchain = sample(turing_model, externalsampler(sampler; unconstrained=false), 10_000; progress=false)\n\nChains MCMC chain (10000×4×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:10000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 10000\nWall duration     = 0.29 seconds\nCompute duration  = 0.29 seconds\nparameters        = x\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nThe fun thing is that this still sort of works because\n\nlogpdf(Beta(3, 3), 10.0)\n\n-Inf\n\n\nand so the samples that fall outside of the range are always rejected. But do notice how much worse all the diagnostics are, e.g. ess_tail is very poor compared to when we use unconstrained=true.

    "text": "Choose your AD backend\nAutomatic differentiation (AD) makes it possible to use modern, efficient gradient-based samplers like NUTS and HMC. This, however, also means that using a performant AD system is incredibly important. Turing currently supports several AD backends, including ForwardDiff (the default), Mooncake, and ReverseDiff.\nFor many common types of models, the default ForwardDiff backend performs well, and there is no need to worry about changing it. However, if you need more speed, you can try different backends via the standard ADTypes interface by passing an AbstractADType to the sampler with the optional adtype argument, e.g. NUTS(; adtype = AutoMooncake()).\nGenerally, adtype = AutoForwardDiff() is likely to be the fastest and most reliable for models with few parameters (say, less than 20 or so), while reverse-mode backends such as AutoMooncake() or AutoReverseDiff() will perform better for models with many parameters or linear algebra operations. If in doubt, you can benchmark your model with different backends to see which one performs best. See the Automatic Differentiation page for details.\n\nSpecial care for ReverseDiff with a compiled tape\nFor large models, the fastest option is often ReverseDiff with a compiled tape, specified as adtype=AutoReverseDiff(; compile=true). However, it is important to note that if your model contains any branching code, such as if-else statements, the gradients from a compiled tape may be inaccurate, leading to erroneous results. If you use this option for the (considerable) speedup it can provide, make sure to check your code for branching and ensure that it does not affect the gradients. It is also a good idea to verify your gradients with another backend.",

Therefore, to use our CustomUniform as a prior in a model we also need to define how to transform samples from [0, 1] to ℝ. To do this, we need to define the corresponding Bijector from Bijectors.jl, which is what Turing.jl uses internally to deal with constrained distributions.\nTo transform from [0, 1] to ℝ we can use the Logit bijector:\n\nBijectors.bijector(d::CustomUniform) = Logit(0.0, 1.0)\n\nIn the present example, CustomUniform is a subtype of ContinuousUnivariateDistribution. The procedure for subtypes of ContinuousMultivariateDistribution and ContinuousMatrixDistribution is exactly the same. For example, Wishart defines a distribution over positive-definite matrices and so bijector returns a PDBijector when called with a Wishart distribution as an argument. For discrete distributions, there is no need to define a bijector; the Identity bijector is used by default.\nAs an alternative to the above, for UnivariateDistribution we could define the minimum and maximum of the distribution:\n\nDistributions.minimum(d::CustomUniform) = 0.0\nDistributions.maximum(d::CustomUniform) = 1.0\n\nand Bijectors.jl will return a default Bijector called TruncatedBijector which makes use of minimum and maximum derive the correct transformation.\nInternally, Turing basically does the following when it needs to convert a constrained distribution to an unconstrained distribution, e.g. when sampling using HMC:\n\ndist = Gamma(2,3)\nb = bijector(dist)\ntransformed_dist = transformed(dist, b) # results in distribution with transformed support + correction for logpdf\n\nBijectors.UnivariateTransformed{Distributions.Gamma{Float64}, Base.Fix1{typeof(broadcast), typeof(log)}}(\ndist: Distributions.Gamma{Float64}(α=2.0, θ=3.0)\ntransform: Base.Fix1{typeof(broadcast), typeof(log)}(broadcast, log)\n)\n\n\nand then we can call rand and logpdf as usual, where\n\nrand(transformed_dist) returns a sample in the unconstrained space, and\nlogpdf(transformed_dist, y) returns the log density of the original distribution, but with y living in the unconstrained space.\n\nTo read more about Bijectors.jl, check out its documentation.",

By default Turing typically uses the LBFGS method from Optim.jl to find the mode estimate, but we can easily change that:\n\nusing OptimizationOptimJL: NelderMead\n@show maximum_likelihood(model, NelderMead())\n\nusing OptimizationNLopt: NLopt.LD_TNEWTON_PRECOND_RESTART\n@show maximum_likelihood(model, LD_TNEWTON_PRECOND_RESTART());\n\n\nmaximum_likelihood(model, NelderMead()) = [0.0624958894249953, 1.7499959023822063]\n┌ Warning: The selected optimization algorithm requires second order derivatives, but `SecondOrder` ADtype was not provided. \n│         So a `SecondOrder` with ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff() for both inner and outer will be created, this can be suboptimal and not work in some cases so \n│         an explicit `SecondOrder` ADtype is recommended.\n└ @ OptimizationBase ~/.julia/packages/OptimizationBase/77acV/src/cache.jl:49\nmaximum_likelihood(model, LD_TNEWTON_PRECOND_RESTART()) = [0.0625000000121515, 1.7499999998783697]\n\n\n\n\nThe above are just two examples, Optimization.jl supports many more.\nWe can also help the optimisation by giving it a starting point we know is close to the final solution, or by specifying an automatic differentiation method\n\nimport Mooncake\n\nmaximum_likelihood(\n    model, NelderMead(); initial_params=[0.1, 2], adtype=AutoMooncake()\n)\n\nModeResult with maximized lp of -0.07\n[0.062494553692639856, 1.7500042095865365]\n\n\nWhen providing values to arguments like initial_params the parameters are typically specified in the order in which they appear in the code of the model, so in this case first s² then m. More precisely it’s the order returned by Turing.Inference.getparams(model, DynamicPPL.VarInfo(model)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInitialisation strategies and consistency with MCMC sampling\n\n\n\nSince Turing v0.41, for MCMC sampling, the initial_params argument must be a DynamicPPL.AbstractInitStrategy as described in the sampling options page). The optimisation interface has not yet been updated to use this; thus, initial parameters are still specified as Vectors. We expect that this will be changed in the near future.\n\n\nWe can also do constrained optimisation, by providing either intervals within which the parameters must stay, or costraint functions that they need to respect. For instance, here’s how one can find the MLE with the constraint that the variance must be less than 0.01 and the mean must be between -1 and 1.:\n\nmaximum_likelihood(model; lb=[0.0, -1.0], ub=[0.01, 1.0])\n\nModeResult with maximized lp of -59.73\n[0.009999999813697837, 0.999999992361611]\n\n\nThe arguments for lower (lb) and upper (ub) bounds follow the arguments of Optimization.OptimizationProblem, as do other parameters for providing constraints, such as cons. Any extraneous keyword arguments given to maximum_likelihood or maximum_a_posteriori are passed to Optimization.solve. Some often useful ones are maxiters for controlling the maximum number of iterations and abstol and reltol for the absolute and relative convergence tolerances:\n\nbadly_converged_mle = maximum_likelihood(\n    model, NelderMead(); maxiters=10, reltol=1e-9\n)\n\nModeResult with maximized lp of -0.67\n[0.16566861652356474, 1.9553432121397942]\n\n\nWe can check whether the optimisation converged using the optim_result field of the result:\n\n@show badly_converged_mle.optim_result;\n\nbadly_converged_mle.optim_result = retcode: Failure\nu: [-1.797765771862933, 1.9553432121397942]\nFinal objective value:     0.6718895816367795\n\n\n\nFor more details, such as a full list of possible arguments, we encourage the reader to read the docstring of the function Turing.Optimisation.estimate_mode, which is what maximum_likelihood and maximum_a_posteriori call, and the documentation of Optimization.jl.",

For example, you can condition a variable in a submodel in two ways:\n\n# From the outside; the prefix `x` must be applied because\n# from the perspective of `outer`, the variable is called\n# `x.a`.\nouter_conditioned1 = outer() | (@varname(x.a) =&gt; 1);\nrand(Xoshiro(468), outer_conditioned1)\n\n(b = 101.07200886749732,)\n\n\nOr equivalently, from the inside:\n\n@model function outer_conditioned2()\n    # The prefix doesn't need to be applied here because\n    # `inner` itself has no knowledge of the prefix.\n    x ~ to_submodel(inner() | (@varname(a) =&gt; 1))\n    b ~ Normal(x)\nend\nrand(Xoshiro(468), outer_conditioned2())\n\n(b = 101.07200886749732,)\n\n\nIn both cases the variable x.a does not appear.\nNote, however, that you cannot condition on the return value of a submodel. Thus, for example, if we had:\n\n@model function inner_sensible()\n    a ~ Normal()\n    return a\nend\n\n@model function outer()\n    x ~ to_submodel(inner())\n    b ~ Normal(x)\nend\n\nouter (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nand we tried to condition on x, it would be silently ignored, even though x is equal to a.\nThe reason for this is because it is entirely coincidental that the return value of the submodel is equal to a. In general, a return value can be anything, and conditioning on it is in general not a meaningful operation.\n\n\nPrefixing\nPrefixing is the only place where submodel behaviour is ‘special’ compared to that of ordinary models.\nBy default, all variables in a submodel are prefixed with the left-hand side of the tilde-statement.

    "text": "Example: linear models\nHere is a motivating example for the use of submodels. Suppose we want to fit a (very simplified) regression model to some data \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where\n\\[\\begin{align}\nc_0 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 5) \\\\\nc_1 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 5) \\\\\n\\mu &= c_0 + c_1x \\\\\ny &\\sim d\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(d\\) is some distribution parameterised by the value of \\(\\mu\\), which we don’t know the exact form of.\nIn practice, what we would do is to write several different models, one for each function \\(f\\):\n\n@model function normal(x, y)\n    c0 ~ Normal(0, 5)\n    c1 ~ Normal(0, 5)\n    mu = c0 .+ c1 .* x\n    # Assume that y = mu, and that the noise in `y` is\n    # normally distributed with standard deviation sigma\n    sigma ~ truncated(Cauchy(0, 3); lower=0)\n    for i in eachindex(y)\n        y[i] ~ Normal(mu[i], sigma)\n    end\nend\n\n@model function logpoisson(x, y)\n    c0 ~ Normal(0, 5)\n    c1 ~ Normal(0, 5)\n    mu = c0 .+ c1 .* x\n    # exponentiate mu because the rate parameter of\n    # a Poisson distribution must be positive\n    for i in eachindex(y)\n        y[i] ~ Poisson(exp(mu[i]))\n    end\nend\n\n# and so on...\n\nlogpoisson (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou could use arraydist to avoid the loops: for example, in logpoisson, one could write y ~ arraydist(Poisson.(exp.(mu))), but for simplicity in this tutorial we spell it out fully.\n\n\nWe would then fit all of our models and use some criterion to test which model is most suitable (see e.g. Wikipedia, or section 3.4 of Bishop’s Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning).\nHowever, the code above is quite repetitive. For example, if we wanted to adjust the priors on c0 and c1, we would have to do it in each model separately. If this was any other kind of code, we would naturally think of extracting the common parts into a separate function. In this case we can do exactly that with a submodel:\n\n@model function priors(x)\n    c0 ~ Normal(0, 5)\n    c1 ~ Normal(0, 5)\n    mu = c0 .+ c1 .* x\n    return (; c0=c0, c1=c1, mu=mu)\nend\n\n@model function normal(x, y)\n    ps = to_submodel(priors(x))\n    sigma ~ truncated(Cauchy(0, 3); lower=0)\n    for i in eachindex(y)\n        y[i] ~ Normal(ps.mu[i], sigma)\n    end\nend\n\n@model function logpoisson(x, y)\n    ps = to_submodel(priors(x))\n    for i in eachindex(y)\n        y[i] ~ Poisson(exp(ps.mu[i]))\n    end\nend\n\nlogpoisson (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nOne could go even further and extract the y section into its own submodel as well, which would bring us to a generalised linear modelling interface that does not actually require the user to define their own Turing models at all:\n\n@model function normal_family(mu, y)\n    sigma ~ truncated(Cauchy(0, 3); lower=0)\n    for i in eachindex(y)\n        y[i] ~ Normal(mu[i], sigma)\n    end\n    return nothing\nend\n\n@model function logpoisson_family(mu, y)\n    for i in eachindex(y)\n        y[i] ~ Poisson(exp(mu[i]))\n    end\n    return nothing\nend\n\n# An end-user could just use this function. Of course,\n# a more thorough interface would also allow the user to\n# specify priors, etc.\nfunction make_model(x, y, family::Symbol)\n    if family == :normal\n        family_model = normal_family\n    elseif family == :logpoisson\n        family_model = logpoisson_family\n    else\n        error(\"unknown family: `$family`\")\n    end\n\n    @model function general(x, y)\n        ps ~ to_submodel(priors(x), false)\n        _n ~ to_submodel(family_model(ps.mu, y), false)\n    end\n    return general(x, y)\nend\n\nsample(make_model([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], :normal), NUTS(), 1000; progress=false)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.8\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×17×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 9.06 seconds\nCompute duration  = 9.06 seconds\nparameters        = c0, c1, sigma\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nWhile this final example really showcases the composability of submodels, it also illustrates a minor syntactic drawback. When we create a submodel from family_model(ps.mu, y), in principle, we do not really care about its return value because it is not used anywhere else in the model. Ideally, we should therefore not need to place anything on the left-hand side of to_submodel. However, because the special behaviour of to_submodel relies on the tilde operator, and the tilde operator requires a left-hand side, we have to use a dummy variable (here _n).\nFurthermore, because the left-hand side of a tilde-statement must be a valid variable name, we cannot use destructuring syntax on the left-hand side of to_submodel, even if the return value is a NamedTuple. Thus, for example, the following is not allowed:\n(; c0, c1, mu) ~ to_submodel(priors(x))\nTo use destructuring syntax, you would have to add a separate line:\nps = to_submodel(priors(x))\n(; c0, c1, mu) = ps",

    "text": "Submodels versus distributions\nFinally, we end with a discussion of why some of the behaviour for submodels above has come about. This is slightly more behind-the-scenes and therefore will likely be of most interest to Turing developers.\nFundamentally, submodels are to be compared against distributions: both of them can appear on the right-hand side of a tilde statement. However, distributions only have one ‘output’, i.e., the value that is sampled from them:\n\ndist = Normal()\nrand(dist)\n\n-0.2965191974352297\n\n\nAnother point to bear in mind is that, given a sample from dist, asking for its log-probability is a meaningful calculation.\n\nlogpdf(dist, rand(dist))\n\n-4.210069250003201\n\n\nIn contrast, models (and hence submodels) have two different outputs: the latent variables, and the return value. These are accessed respectively using rand(model) and model():\n\n@model function f()\n    a ~ Normal()\n    return \"hello, world.\"\nend\n\nmodel = f()\n\nDynamicPPL.Model{typeof(f), (), (), (), Tuple{}, Tuple{}, DynamicPPL.DefaultContext}(f, NamedTuple(), NamedTuple(), DynamicPPL.DefaultContext())\n\n\n\n# Latent variables\nrand(model)\n\n(a = -0.6355562676241745,)\n\n\n\n# Return value\nmodel()\n\n\"hello, world.\"\n\n\nJust like for distributions, one can indeed ask for the log-probability of the latent variables (although we have to specify whether we want the joint, likelihood, or prior):\n\nlogjoint(model, rand(model))\n\n-0.9474854050066628\n\n\nBut it does not make sense to ask for the log-probability of the return value (which in this case is a string, and in general, could be literally any object).\nThe fact that we have what looks like a unified notation for these is a bit of a lie, since it hides this distinction. In particular, for x ~ distr, x is assigned the value of rand(distr); but for y ~ submodel, y is assigned the value of submodel(). This is why, for example, it is impossible to condition on y in y ~ ...; we can only condition on x in x ~ dist.\nEventually we would like to make this more logically consistent. In particular, it is clear that y ~ submodel should return not one but two objects: the latent variables and the return value. Furthermore, it should be possible to condition on the latent variables, but not on the return value. See this issue for an ongoing discussion of the best way to accomplish this.\nIt should be mentioned that extracting the latent variables from a submodel is not entirely trivial since the submodel is run using the same VarInfo as the parent model (i.e., we would have to do a before-and-after comparison to see which new variables were added by the submodel).\nAlso, we are still working out the exact data structure that should be used to represent the latent variables. In the examples above rand(model) returns a NamedTuple, but this actually causes loss of information because the keys of a NamedTuple are Symbols, whereas we really want to use VarNames.

    "text": "Which to use?\nThere are some pros and cons of using returned, as opposed to :=.\nFirstly, returned is more flexible, as it allows you to track any type of object; := only works with variables that can be inserted into an MCMCChains.Chains object. (Notice that x is a vector, and in the first case where we used :=, reconstructing the vector value of x can also be rather annoying as the chain stores each individual element of x separately.)\nA drawback is that naively using returned can lead to unnecessary computation during inference. This is because during the sampling process, the return values are also calculated (since they are part of the model function), but then thrown away. So, if the extra quantities are expensive to compute, this can be a problem.\nTo avoid this, you will essentially have to create two different models, one for inference and one for post-inference. The simplest way of doing this is to add a parameter to the model argument:\n\n@model function Neal_coloneq_optional(track::Bool)\n    # Raw draws\n    y_raw ~ Normal(0, 1)\n    x_raw ~ arraydist([Normal(0, 1) for i in 1:9])\n\n    if track\n        y = 3 * y_raw\n        x = exp.(y ./ 2) .* x_raw\n        return (x=x, y=y)\n    else\n        return nothing\n    end\nend\n\nchain = sample(Neal_coloneq_optional(false), NUTS(), 1000)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 1.6\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×24×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 1.71 seconds\nCompute duration  = 1.71 seconds\nparameters        = y_raw, x_raw[1], x_raw[2], x_raw[3], x_raw[4], x_raw[5], x_raw[6],

numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nThe above ensures that x and y are not calculated during inference, but allows us to still use returned to extract them:\n\nreturned(Neal_coloneq_optional(true), chain)\n\n1000×1 Matrix{@NamedTuple{x::Vector{Float64}, y::Float64}}:\n (x =

    "text": "Choosing an AD Backend\nThere are two aspects to choosing an AD backend: firstly, what backends are available; and secondly, which backend is best for your model.\n\nUsable AD Backends\nTuring.jl uses the functionality in DifferentiationInterface.jl (‘DI’) to interface with AD libraries in a unified way. In principle, any AD library that DI provides an interface for can be used with Turing; you should consult the DI documentation for an up-to-date list of compatible AD libraries.\nNote, however, that not all AD libraries in there are thoroughly tested on Turing models. Thus, it is possible that some of them will either error (because they don’t know how to differentiate through Turing’s code), or maybe even silently give incorrect results (if you are very unlucky). Turing is most extensively tested with ForwardDiff.jl (the default), ReverseDiff.jl, and Mooncake.jl. We also run a smaller set of tests with Enzyme.jl.\n\n\nADTests\nBefore describing how to choose the best AD backend for your model, we should mention that we also publish a table of benchmarks for various models and AD backends in the ADTests website. These models aim to capture a variety of different features of Turing.jl and Julia in general, so that you can see which AD backends may be compatible with your model. Benchmarks are also included, although it should be noted that many of the models in ADTests are small and thus the timings may not be representative of larger, real-life models.\nIf you have suggestions for other models to include, please do let us know by creating an issue on GitHub!\n\n\nThe Best AD Backend for Your Model\nGiven the number of possible backends, how do you choose the best one for your model?\nA simple heuristic is to look at the number of parameters in your model. The log density of the model, i.e. the function being differentiated, is a function that goes from \\(\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of parameters in your model. For models with a small number of parameters (say up to ~ 20), forward-mode AD (e.g. ForwardDiff) is generally faster due to a smaller overhead. On the other hand, for models with a large number of parameters, reverse-mode AD (e.g. ReverseDiff or Mooncake) is generally faster as it computes the gradients with respect to all parameters in a single pass.\nThe most exact way to ensure you are using the fastest AD that works for your problem is to benchmark them using the functionality in DynamicPPL (see the API documentation):\n\nusing ADTypes\nusing DynamicPPL.TestUtils.AD: run_ad, ADResult\nusing ForwardDiff, ReverseDiff\n\n@model function gdemo(x, y)\n    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))\n    x ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    return y ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\nend\nmodel = gdemo(1.5, 2)\n\nfor adtype in [AutoForwardDiff(), AutoReverseDiff()]\n    result = run_ad(model, adtype; benchmark=true)\n    @show result.grad_time / result.primal_time\nend\n\n\n[ Info: Running AD on gdemo with ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff()\n       params : [0.44244119561360457, 3.3428726485100575]\n       actual : (-9.295494947853653, [3.687359740928239, -4.19441583835939])\n     expected : (-9.295494947853653, [3.687359740928239, -4.19441583835939])\ngrad / primal : 5.272e-7/3.375e-7 = 1.562\nresult.grad_time / result.primal_time = 1.5621128009275043\n[ Info: Running AD on gdemo with ADTypes.AutoReverseDiff()\n       params : [0.11274722497137994, -0.7879522299489632]\n       actual : (-9.721924229292341, [5.267717919614712, 5.238631501242477])\n     expected : (-9.721924229292341, [5.267717919614712, 5.238631501242477])\ngrad / primal : 1.55e-5/3.421e-7 = 45.31\nresult.grad_time / result.primal_time = 45.30594491794041\n\n\n\n\nIn this specific instance, ForwardDiff is clearly faster (due to the small size of the model).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteA note about ReverseDiff’s compile argument\n\n\n\nThe additional keyword argument compile=true for AutoReverseDiff specifies whether to pre-record the tape only once and reuse it later. By default, this is set to false, which means no pre-recording. Setting compile=true can substantially improve performance, but risks silently incorrect results if not used with care. Pre-recorded tapes should only be used if you are absolutely certain that the sequence of operations performed in your code does not change between different executions of your model.",

    "text": "Going beyond the Turing API\nAs previously mentioned, the Turing wrappers can often limit the capabilities of the sampling libraries they wrap. AdvancedHMC1 (AdvancedHMC’s GitHub) is a clear example of this. A common practice when performing HMC is to provide an initial guess for the mass matrix. However, the native HMC sampler within Turing only allows the user to specify the type of the mass matrix despite the two options being possible within AdvancedHMC. Thankfully, we can use Turing’s support for external samplers to define an HMC sampler with a custom mass matrix in AdvancedHMC and then use it to sample our Turing model.\nWe can use the library Pathfinder2 (Pathfinder’s GitHub) to construct our estimate of mass matrix. Pathfinder is a variational inference algorithm that first finds the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of a target posterior distribution and then uses the trace of the optimization to construct a sequence of multivariate normal approximations to the target distribution. In this process, Pathfinder computes an estimate of the mass matrix the user can access. You can see an example of how to use Pathfinder with Turing in Pathfinder’s docs.",

    "section": "Using new inference methods",
    "text": "Using new inference methods\nSo far we have used Turing’s support for external samplers to go beyond the capabilities of the wrappers. This is made possible by an interface for external samplers, which is described in the Turing.jl documentation here: if you are implementing your own sampler and would like it to work with Turing.jl models, that link describes the methods that you need to overload.\nFor an example of an ‘external sampler’ that works in this way with Turing, we recommend the SliceSampling.jl library. Note that although this library is hosted under the TuringLang GitHub organisation, it is not a Turing.jl dependency, and thus from Turing’s perspective it is truly an ‘external’ sampler.\nIn this section, we will briefly go through the interface requirements for external samplers. First and foremost, the sampler MySampler should be a subtype of AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler. Second, the stepping function of the MCMC algorithm must be defined as new methods of AbstractMCMC.step following the structure below:\n# First step\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    model::AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel,\n    spl::MySampler;\n    kwargs...,\n)\n    [...]\n    return transition, state\nend\n\n# N+1 step\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    model::AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel,\n    sampler::MySampler,\n    state;\n    kwargs...,\n) \n    [...]\n    return transition, state\nend\nNote that the model argument here must be an AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel. This is a thin wrapper around an object which satisfies the LogDensityProblems.jl interface. Thus, in your external sampler, you can access the inner object with model.logdensity and call LogDensityProblems.logdensity(model.logdensity, params) to calculate the (unnormalised) log density of the model at params.\nAs shown above, there must be two step methods:\n\nA method that performs the first step, performing any initialisation it needs to; and\nA method that performs the following steps and takes an extra input, state, which carries the initialization information.\n\nThe output of both of these methods must be a tuple containing: - a ‘transition’, which is essentially the ‘visible output’ of the sampler: this object is later used to construct an MCMCChains.Chains; - a ‘state’, representing the current state of the sampler, which is passed to the next step of the MCMC algorithm.\nApart from this, your sampler state should also implement Turing.Inference.getparams(model, transition) to return the parameters of the model as a vector. Here, transition represents the first output of the step function.\nfunction Turing.Inference.getparams(model::DynamicPPL.Model, state::MyTransition)\n    # Return a vector containing the parameters of the model.\nend\nThese functions are the bare minimum that your external sampler must implement to work with Turing models. There are other methods which can be overloaded to improve the performance or other features of the sampler; please refer to the documentation linked above for more details.\nIn general, we recommend that the AbstractMCMC interface is implemented directly in your library. However, any DynamicPPL- or Turing-specific functionality is best implemented in a MySamplerTuringExt extension.",

There are three main options, all of which are re-exported by Turing.\n\nInitFromPrior(): generate initial parameters by sampling from the prior\nInitFromUniform(lower, upper): generate initial parameters by sampling uniformly from the given bounds in linked space\nInitFromParams(namedtuple_or_dict): use the provided initial parameters, supplied either as a NamedTuple or a Dict{&lt;:VarName}\n\nIf initial_params is unspecified, each sampler will use its own default initialisation strategy: for most samplers this is InitFromPrior but for Hamiltonian samplers it is InitFromUniform(-2, 2) (which mimics the behaviour of Stan).\n\nchn = sample(demo_model(), MH(), 5; initial_params=InitFromParams((x = 1.0, y = -5.0)))\nchn[:x][1], chn[:y][1]\n\n(1.0, -5.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that a number of samplers use warm-up steps by default (see the Thinning and Warmup section below), so chn[:param][1] may not correspond to the exact initial parameters you provided.

For single-chain sampling, the saved state, and the required initial state, is just a single sampler state. For multiple-chain sampling, it is a vector of states, one per chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningresume_from\n\n\n\nThe resume_from argument has been removed in Turing v0.41; please use initial_state=loadstate(chn) instead, as described here. In v0.41, loadstate is also exported from Turing rather than DynamicPPL.\n\n\nThis means that, for example, after sampling a single chain, you could sample three chains that branch off from that final state:\n\ninitial_states = fill(saved_state, 3)\nchn3 = sample(demo_model(), MH(), MCMCThreads(), 5, 3; initial_state=initial_states)\n\n\n┌ Warning: Only a single thread available: MCMC chains are not sampled in parallel\n└ @ AbstractMCMC ~/.julia/packages/AbstractMCMC/z4BsN/src/sample.jl:432\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (5×5×3 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:5\nNumber of chains  = 3\nSamples per chain = 5\nWall duration     = 0.04 seconds\nCompute duration  = 0.02 seconds\nparameters        = x, y\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInitial states versus initial parameters\n\n\n\nThe initial_state and initial_params keyword arguments are mutually exclusive. If both are provided, initial_params will be silently ignored.\n\nchn2 = sample(rng, demo_model(), MH(), 5;\n    initial_state=saved_state, initial_params=InitFromParams((x=0.0, y=0.0))\n)\nchn2[:x][1], chn2[:y][1]\n\n(0.6039098670263787, 3.189622703262277)\n\n\nIn general, the saved state will contain a set of parameters (which will be the last parameters in the previous chain). However, the saved state not only specifies parameters but also other internal variables required by the sampler. For example, the MH state contains a cached log-density of the current parameters, which is later used for calculating the acceptance ratio.\nFinally, note that the first sample in the resumed chain will not be the same as the last sample in the previous chain; it will be the sample immediately after that.\n\n# In general these will not be the same (although it _could_ be if the MH step\n# was rejected -- that is why we seed the sampling in this section).\nchn1[:x][end], chn2[:x][1]\n\n(-0.3719817960998872, 0.6039098670263787)",

Both of these are integers, and respectively specify the number of warmup steps to perform, and the number of iterations at the start of the chain to discard. Note that the value of discard_initial should also include the num_warmup steps if you want the warmup steps to be discarded.\nHere are some examples of how these two keyword arguments interact:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnum_warmup=\ndiscard_initial=\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n10\n10\nPerform 10 warmup steps, discard them; the chain starts from the first non-warmup step\n\n\n10\n15\nPerform 10 warmup steps, discard them and the next 5 steps; the chain starts from the 6th non-warmup step\n\n\n10\n5\nPerform 10 warmup steps, discard the first 5; the chain will contain 5 warmup steps followed by the rest of the chain\n\n\n0\n10\nNo warmup steps, discard the first 10 steps; the chain starts from the 11th step\n\n\n0\n0\nNo warmup steps, do not discard any steps; the chain starts from the 1st step (corresponding to the initial parameters)\n\n\n\nEach sampler has its own default value for num_warmup, but discard_initial always defaults to num_warmup.\nWarmup steps and ‘regular’ non-warmup steps differ in that warmup steps call AbstractMCMC.step_warmup, whereas regular steps call AbstractMCMC.step. For all the samplers defined in Turing, these two functions are identical; however, they may in general differ for other samplers. Please consult the documentation of the respective sampler for details.\nA thinning factor can be specified using the thinning keyword argument. For example, thinning=10 will keep every tenth sample, discarding the other nine.\nNote that thinning is not applied to the first discard_initial samples; it is only applied to the remaining samples. Thus, for example, if you use discard_initial=50 and thinning=10, the chain will contain samples 51, 61, 71, and so on.",

    "text": "Initial parameters\n\nfailed to find valid initial parameters in {N} tries. This may indicate an error with the model or AD backend…\n\nThis error is seen when a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler is unable to determine a valid set of initial parameters for the sampling. Here, ‘valid’ means that the log probability density of the model, as well as its gradient with respect to each parameter, is finite and not NaN.\n\nNaN gradient\nOne of the most common causes of this error is having a NaN gradient. To find out whether this is happening, you can evaluate the gradient manually. Here is an example with a model that is known to be problematic:\n\nusing Turing\nusing DynamicPPL.TestUtils.AD: run_ad\n\n@model function initial_bad()\n    a ~ Normal()\n    x ~ truncated(Normal(a), 0, Inf)\nend\n\nmodel = initial_bad()\nadtype = AutoForwardDiff()\nresult = run_ad(model, adtype; test=false, benchmark=false)\nresult.grad_actual\n\n\n[ Info: Running AD on initial_bad with ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff()\n       params : [1.1987437447628437, -0.9668808105054878]\n       actual : (-3.7356807172902218, [NaN, NaN])\n\n\n\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n NaN\n NaN\n\n\n(See the DynamicPPL docs for more details on the run_ad function and its return type.)\nIn this case, the NaN gradient is caused by the Inf argument to truncated. (See, e.g., this issue on Distributions.jl.) Here, the upper bound of Inf is not needed, so it can be removed:\n\n@model function initial_good()\n    a ~ Normal()\n    x ~ truncated(Normal(a); lower=0)\nend\n\nmodel = initial_good()\nadtype = AutoForwardDiff()\nrun_ad(model, adtype; test=false, benchmark=false).grad_actual\n\n\n[ Info: Running AD on initial_good with ADTypes.AutoForwardDiff()\n       params : [-0.6699848234432777, -1.1212354589783122]\n       actual : (-2.2988468679726317, [0.3981551884233261, 0.6754716182071021])\n\n\n\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.3981551884233261\n 0.6754716182071021\n\n\nMore generally, you could try using a different AD backend; if you don’t know why a model is returning NaN gradients, feel free to open an issue.\n\n\n-Inf log density\nAnother cause of this error is having models with very extreme parameters. This example is taken from this Turing.jl issue:\n\n@model function initial_bad2()\n    x ~ Exponential(100)\n    y ~ Uniform(0, x)\nend\nmodel = initial_bad2() | (y = 50.0,)\n\nDynamicPPL.Model{typeof(initial_bad2), (), (), (), Tuple{}, Tuple{}, DynamicPPL.ConditionContext{@NamedTuple{y::Float64}, DynamicPPL.DefaultContext}}(initial_bad2, NamedTuple(), NamedTuple(), ConditionContext((y = 50.0,), DynamicPPL.DefaultContext()))\n\n\nThe problem here is that HMC’s default initialisation strategy is InitFromUniform(-2, 2): in other words, it attempts to find initial values for transformed parameters inside the region of [-2, 2]. For a distribution of Exponential(100), the appropriate transformation is log(x) (see the variable transformation docs for more info).\nThus, HMC attempts to find initial values of log(x) in the region of [-2, 2], which corresponds to x in the region of [exp(-2), exp(2)] = [0.135, 7.39]. However, all of these values of x will give rise to a zero probability density for y because the value of y = 50.0 is outside the support of Uniform(0, x). Thus, the log density of the model is -Inf, as can be seen with logjoint:\n\nlogjoint(model, (x = exp(-2),))\n\n-Inf\n\n\n\nlogjoint(model, (x = exp(2),))\n\n-Inf\n\n\nYou can fix this by overriding the default initialisation strategy (discussed in more detail in the sampling options page).\n\n# Use initial parameters drawn from the model's prior.\nsample(model, NUTS(), 1000; initial_params=InitFromPrior())\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 1.6\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×15×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 4.1 seconds\nCompute duration  = 4.1 seconds\nparameters        = x\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\n# Use manually specified initial parameters (always in untransformed space).\nsample(model, NUTS(), 1000; initial_params=InitFromParams((x = 60.0,)))\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 1.6\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×15×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 0.46 seconds\nCompute duration  = 0.46 seconds\nparameters        = x\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nMore generally, you may also consider reparameterising the model to avoid such issues.",

is the line x[1] = a. When the log probability density of the model is calculated, a is sampled from a normal distribution and is thus a Float64; however, when ForwardDiff calculates the gradient of the log density, a is a ForwardDiff.Dual object. However, x is always a Vector{Float64}, and the call x[1] = a attempts to insert a Dual object into a Vector{Float64}, which is not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn more depth: the basic premise of ForwardDiff is that functions have to accept Real parameters instead of Float64 (since Dual is a subtype of Real). Here, the line x[1] = a is equivalent to setindex!(x, a, 1), and although the method setindex!(::Vector{Float64}, ::Real, ...) does exist, it attempts to convert the Real into a Float64, which is where it fails.\n\n\nThere are two ways around this.\nFirstly, you could broaden the type of the container:\n\n@model function forwarddiff_working1()\n    x = Real[0.0, 1.0]\n    a ~ Normal()\n    x[1] = a\n    b ~ MvNormal(x, I)\nend\nsample(forwarddiff_working1(), NUTS(; adtype=AutoForwardDiff()), 10)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 1.6\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (10×17×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 6:1:15\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 10\nWall duration     = 3.19 seconds\nCompute duration  = 3.19 seconds\nparameters        = a, b[1], b[2]\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nThis is generally unfavourable because the Vector{Real} type contains an abstract type parameter. As a result, memory allocation is less efficient (because the compiler does not know the size of each vector’s elements). Furthermore, the compiler cannot infer the type of x[1], which can lead to type stability issues (to see this in action, run x = Real[0.0, 1.0]; @code_warntype x[1] in the Julia REPL).\nA better solution is to pass a type as a parameter to the model:\n\n@model function forwarddiff_working2(::Type{T}=Float64) where T\n    x = T[0.0, 1.0]\n    a ~ Normal()\n    x[1] = a\n    b ~ MvNormal(x, I)\nend\nsample(forwarddiff_working2(), NUTS(; adtype=AutoForwardDiff()), 10)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 1.6\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (10×17×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 6:1:15\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 10\nWall duration     = 1.65 seconds\nCompute duration  = 1.65 seconds\nparameters        = a, b[1], b[2]\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use a different AD backend such as Mooncake which does not rely on dual numbers.",

Now you’ve introduced \\(p(x_i)\\) which we also can’t compute (in general)!”. Woah. Calm down human. Let’s do some more algebra. The above expression can be rearranged to\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{D\\_{KL}} \\left( q(z), p(z \\mid \\\\{ x\\_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n) \\right) + \\underbrace{\\sum\\_{i = 1}^n \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim q(z)} \\left[ \\log p(x\\_i, z) \\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim q(z)} \\left[ \\log q(z) \\right]}\\_{=: \\mathrm{ELBO}(q)} = \\underbrace{\\sum\\_{i = 1}^n \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim q(z)} \\left[ \\log p(x\\_i) \\right]}\\_{\\text{constant}}.\n\\]\n\nSee? The left-hand side is constant and, as we mentioned before, \\(\\mathrm{D_{KL}} \\ge 0\\). What happens if we try to maximize the term we just gave the completely arbitrary name \\(\\mathrm{ELBO}\\)? Well, if \\(\\mathrm{ELBO}\\) goes up while \\(p(x_i)\\) stays constant then \\(\\mathrm{D_{KL}}\\) has to go down! That is, the \\(q(z)\\) which minimizes the KL-divergence is the same \\(q(z)\\) which maximizes \\(\\mathrm{ELBO}(q)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\underset{q}{\\mathrm{argmin}} \\  \\mathrm{D\\_{KL}} \\left( q(z), p(z \\mid \\\\{ x\\_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n) \\right) = \\underset{q}{\\mathrm{argmax}} \\ \\mathrm{ELBO}(q)\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{ELBO}(q) &:= \\left( \\sum\\_{i = 1}^n \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim q(z)} \\left[ \\log p(x\\_i, z) \\right]  \\right) - \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim q(z)} \\left[ \\log q(z) \\right] \\\\\n    &= \\left( \\sum\\_{i = 1}^n \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim q(z)} \\left[ \\log p(x\\_i, z) \\right] \\right) + \\mathbb{H}\\left( q(z) \\right)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand \\(\\mathbb{H} \\left(q(z) \\right)\\) denotes the (differential) entropy of \\(q(z)\\).\nAssuming joint \\(p(x_i, z)\\) and the entropy \\(\\mathbb{H}\\left(q(z)\\right)\\) are both tractable, we can use a Monte-Carlo for the remaining expectation. This leaves us with the following tractable expression\n\n\\[\n\\underset{q}{\\mathrm{argmin}} \\ \\mathrm{D\\_{KL}} \\left( q(z), p(z \\mid \\\\{ x\\_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n) \\right) \\approx \\underset{q}{\\mathrm{argmax}} \\ \\widehat{\\mathrm{ELBO}}(q)\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{ELBO}}(q) = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\sum\\_{k = 1}^m \\sum\\_{i = 1}^n \\log p(x\\_i, z\\_k) \\right) + \\mathbb{H} \\left(q(z)\\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad z\\_k \\sim q(z) \\quad \\forall k = 1, \\dots, m.\n\\]\n\nHence, as long as we can sample from \\(q(z)\\) somewhat efficiently, we can indeed minimize the KL-divergence! Neat, eh?\nSidenote: in the case where \\(q(z)\\) is tractable but \\(\\mathbb{H} \\left(q(z) \\right)\\) is not , we can use an Monte-Carlo estimate for this term too but this generally results in a higher-variance estimate.\nAlso, I fooled you real good: the ELBO isn’t an arbitrary name, hah! In fact it’s an abbreviation for the expected lower bound (ELBO) because it, uhmm, well, it’s the expected lower bound (remember \\(\\mathrm{D_{KL}} \\ge 0\\)). Yup.",

    "text": "Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI)\nSo let’s revisit the assumptions we’ve made at this point:\n\nThe variational posterior \\(q\\_{\\theta}\\) is in a parameterized family of densities denoted \\(\\mathscr{Q}\\_{\\Theta}\\), with \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\).\n\\(\\mathscr{Q}\\_{\\Theta}\\) is a space of reparameterizable densities with \\(\\bar{q}(z)\\) as the base-density.\nThe parameterization function \\(g\\_{\\theta}\\) is differentiable wrt. \\(\\theta\\).\nEvaluation of the probability density \\(q\\_{\\theta}(z)\\) is differentiable wrt. \\(\\theta\\).\n\\(\\mathbb{H}\\left(q\\_{\\theta}(z)\\right)\\) is tractable.\nEvaluation of the joint density \\(p(x, z)\\) is tractable and differentiable wrt. \\(z\\)\nThe support of \\(q(z)\\) is a subspace of the support of \\(p(z \\mid x)\\) : \\(\\mathrm{supp}\\left(q(z)\\right) \\subseteq \\mathrm{supp}\\left(p(z \\mid x)\\right)\\).\n\nAll of these are not necessary to do VI, but they are very convenient and results in a fairly flexible approach. One distribution which has a density satisfying all of the above assumptions except (7) (we’ll get back to this in second) for any tractable and differentiable \\(p(z \\mid \\\\{ x\\_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n)\\) is the good ole’ Gaussian/normal distribution:\n\n\\[\nz \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma) \\quad \\iff \\quad z = g\\_{\\mu, L}(\\bar{z}) := \\mu + L^T \\tilde{z} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\bar{z} \\sim \\bar{q}(z) := \\mathcal{N}(1\\_d, I\\_{d \\times d})\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Sigma = L L^T,\\) with \\(L\\) obtained from the Cholesky-decomposition. Abusing notation a bit, we’re going to write\n\n\\[\n\\theta = (\\mu, \\Sigma) := (\\mu\\_1, \\dots, \\mu\\_d, L\\_{11}, \\dots, L\\_{1, d}, L\\_{2, 1}, \\dots, L\\_{2, d}, \\dots, L\\_{d, 1}, \\dots, L\\_{d, d}).\n\\]\n\nWith this assumption we finally have a tractable expression for \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{ELBO}}(q_{\\mu, \\Sigma})\\)! Well, assuming (7) is holds. Since a Gaussian has non-zero probability on the entirety of \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\), we also require \\(p(z \\mid \\\\{ x_i \\\\}_{i = 1}^n)\\) to have non-zero probability on all of \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\).\nThough not necessary, we’ll often make a mean-field assumption for the variational posterior \\(q(z)\\), i.e. assume independence between the latent variables. In this case, we’ll write\n\n\\[\n\\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma^2) := (\\mu\\_1, \\dots, \\mu\\_d, \\sigma\\_1^2, \\dots, \\sigma\\_d^2).\n\\]\n\n\nExamples\nAs a (trivial) example we could apply the approach described above to is the following generative model for \\(p(z \\mid \\\\{ x_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n    m &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\\\\n    x\\_i &\\overset{\\text{i.i.d.}}{=} \\mathcal{N}(m, 1), \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn this case \\(z = m\\) and we have the posterior defined \\(p(m \\mid \\\\{ x\\_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n) = p(m) \\prod\\_{i = 1}^n p(x\\_i \\mid m)\\). Then the variational posterior would be\n\n\\[\nq\\_{\\mu, \\sigma} = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2), \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\ \\sigma^2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{ + }.\n\\]\n\nAnd since prior of \\(m\\), \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\), has non-zero probability on the entirety of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), same as \\(q(m)\\), i.e. assumption (7) above holds, everything is fine and life is good.\nBut what about this generative model for \\(p(z \\mid \\\\{ x_i \\\\}_{i = 1}^n)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n    s &\\sim \\mathrm{InverseGamma}(2, 3), \\\\\n    m &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, s), \\\\\n    x\\_i &\\overset{\\text{i.i.d.}}{=} \\mathcal{N}(m, s), \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwith posterior \\(p(s, m \\mid \\\\{ x\\_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n) = p(s) p(m \\mid s) \\prod\\_{i = 1}^n p(x\\_i \\mid s, m)\\) and the mean-field variational posterior \\(q(s, m)\\) will be\n\n\\[\nq\\_{\\mu\\_1, \\mu\\_2, \\sigma\\_1^2, \\sigma\\_2^2}(s, m) = p\\_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu\\_1, \\sigma\\_1^2)}(s)\\ p\\_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu\\_2, \\sigma\\_2^2)}(m),\n\\]\n\nwhere we’ve denoted the evaluation of the probability density of a Gaussian as \\(p_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)}(x)\\).\nObserve that \\(\\mathrm{InverseGamma}(2, 3)\\) has non-zero probability only on \\(\\mathbb{R}^{ + } := (0, \\infty)\\) which is clearly not all of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) like \\(q(s, m)\\) has, i.e.\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{supp} \\left( q(s, m) \\right) \\not\\subseteq \\mathrm{supp} \\left( p(z \\mid \\\\{ x\\_i \\\\}\\_{i = 1}^n) \\right).\n\\]\n\nRecall from the definition of the KL-divergence that when this is the case, the KL-divergence isn’t well defined. This gets us to the automatic part of ADVI.\n\n\n“Automatic”? How?\nFor a lot of the standard (continuous) densities \\(p\\) we can actually construct a probability density \\(\\tilde{p}\\) with non-zero probability on all of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) by transforming the “constrained” probability density \\(p\\) to \\(\\tilde{p}\\). In fact, in these cases this is a one-to-one relationship. As we’ll see, this helps solve the support-issue we’ve been going on and on about.\n\nTransforming densities using change of variables\nIf we want to compute the probability of \\(x\\) taking a value in some set \\(A \\subseteq \\mathrm{supp} \\left( p(x) \\right)\\), we have to integrate \\(p(x)\\) over \\(A\\), i.e.\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P}_p(x \\in A) = \\int_A p(x) \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\n\nThis means that if we have a differentiable bijection \\(f: \\mathrm{supp} \\left( q(x) \\right) \\to \\mathbb{R}^d\\) with differentiable inverse \\(f^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathrm{supp} \\left( p(x) \\right)\\), we can perform a change of variables\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P}\\_p(x \\in A) = \\int\\_{f^{-1}(A)} p \\left(f^{-1}(y) \\right) \\ \\left| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f^{-1}}(y) \\right| \\mathrm{d}y,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{J}_{f^{-1}}(x)\\) denotes the jacobian of \\(f^{-1}\\) evaluated at \\(x\\). Observe that this defines a probability distribution\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P}\\_{\\tilde{p}}\\left(y \\in f^{-1}(A) \\right) = \\int\\_{f^{-1}(A)} \\tilde{p}(y) \\mathrm{d}y,\n\\]\n\nsince \\(f^{-1}\\left(\\mathrm{supp} (p(x)) \\right) = \\mathbb{R}^d\\) which has probability 1. This probability distribution has density \\(\\tilde{p}(y)\\) with \\(\\mathrm{supp} \\left( \\tilde{p}(y) \\right) = \\mathbb{R}^d\\), defined\n\n\\[\n\\tilde{p}(y) = p \\left( f^{-1}(y) \\right) \\ \\left| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f^{-1}}(y) \\right|\n\\]\n\nor equivalently\n\n\\[\n\\tilde{p} \\left( f(x) \\right) = \\frac{p(x)}{\\big| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f}(x) \\big|}\n\\]\n\ndue to the fact that\n\n\\[\n\\big| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f^{-1}}(y) \\big| = \\big| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f}(x) \\big|^{-1}\n\\]\n\nNote: it’s also necessary that the log-abs-det-jacobian term is non-vanishing. This can for example be accomplished by assuming \\(f\\) to also be elementwise monotonic.\n\n\nBack to VI\nSo why is this is useful? Well, we’re looking to generalize our approach using a normal distribution to cases where the supports don’t match up. How about defining \\(q(z)\\) by\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\eta &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma), \\\\\\\\\n  z &= f^{-1}(\\eta),\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(f^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathrm{supp} \\left( p(z \\mid x) \\right)\\) is a differentiable bijection with differentiable inverse. Then \\(z \\sim q_{\\mu, \\Sigma}(z) \\implies z \\in \\mathrm{supp} \\left( p(z \\mid x) \\right)\\) as we wanted. The resulting variational density is\n\n\\[\nq\\_{\\mu, \\Sigma}(z) = p\\_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)}\\left( f(z) \\right) \\ \\big| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f}(z) \\big|.\n\\]\n\nNote that the way we’ve constructed \\(q(z)\\) here is basically a reverse of the approach we described above. Here we sample from a distribution with support on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and transform to \\(\\mathrm{supp} \\left( p(z \\mid x) \\right)\\).\nIf we want to write the ELBO explicitly in terms of \\(\\eta\\) rather than \\(z\\), the first term in the ELBO becomes\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim q_{\\mu, \\Sigma}(z)} \\left[ \\log p(x\\_i, z) \\right] &= \\mathbb{E}\\_{\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)} \\Bigg[ \\log \\frac{p\\left(x\\_i, f^{-1}(\\eta) \\right)}{\\big| \\det \\mathcal{J}_{f^{-1}}(\\eta) \\big|} \\Bigg] \\\\\n  &= \\mathbb{E}\\_{\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)} \\left[ \\log p\\left(x\\_i, f^{-1}(\\eta) \\right) \\right] - \\mathbb{E}\\_{\\eta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)} \\left[ \\left| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f^{-1}}(\\eta) \\right| \\right].\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe entropy is invariant under change of variables, thus \\(\\mathbb{H} \\left(q\\_{\\mu, \\Sigma}(z)\\right)\\) is simply the entropy of the normal distribution which is known analytically.\nHence, the resulting empirical estimate of the ELBO is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{ELBO}}(q\\_{\\mu, \\Sigma}) &= \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\sum\\_{k = 1}^m \\sum\\_{i = 1}^n \\left(\\log p\\left(x\\_i, f^{-1}(\\eta_k)\\right) - \\log \\big| \\det \\mathcal{J}\\_{f^{-1}}(\\eta\\_k) \\big| \\right) \\right) + \\mathbb{H} \\left(p\\_{\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)}(z)\\right) \\\\\n& \\text{where} \\quad z\\_k  \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma) \\quad \\forall k = 1, \\dots, m\n\\end{align*}.\n\\]\n\nAnd maximizing this wrt. \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) is what’s referred to as Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI)!\nNow if you want to try it out, check out the tutorial on how to use ADVI in Turing.jl!",

    "text": "Turing implements a sampling interface (hosted at AbstractMCMC) that is intended to provide a common framework for Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers. The interface presents several structures and functions that one needs to overload in order to implement an interface-compatible sampler.\nThis guide will demonstrate how to implement the interface without Turing.\n\n\nAny implementation of an inference method that uses the AbstractMCMC interface should implement a subset of the following types and functions:\n\nA subtype of AbstractSampler, defined as a mutable struct containing state information or sampler parameters.\nA function sample_init! which performs any necessary set-up (default: do not perform any set-up).\nA function step! which returns a transition that represents a single draw from the sampler.\nA function transitions_init which returns a container for the transitions obtained from the sampler (default: return a Vector{T} of length N where T is the type of the transition obtained in the first step and N is the number of requested samples).\nA function transitions_save! which saves transitions to the container (default: save the transition of iteration i at position i in the vector of transitions).\nA function sample_end! which handles any sampler wrap-up (default: do not perform any wrap-up).\nA function bundle_samples which accepts the container of transitions and returns a collection of samples (default: return the vector of transitions).\n\nThe interface methods with exclamation points are those that are intended to allow for state mutation. Any mutating function is meant to allow mutation where needed – you might use:\n\nsample_init! to run some kind of sampler preparation, before sampling begins. This could mutate a sampler’s state.\nstep! might mutate a sampler flag after each sample.\nsample_end! contains any wrap-up you might need to do. If you were sampling in a transformed space, this might be where you convert everything back to a constrained space.\n\n\n\n\nThe motivation for the interface is to allow Julia’s fantastic probabilistic programming language community to have a set of standards and common implementations so we can all thrive together. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods tend to have a very similar framework to one another, and so a common interface should help more great inference methods built in single-purpose packages to experience more use among the community.\n\n\n\nMetropolis-Hastings is often the first sampling method that people are exposed to. It is a very straightforward algorithm and is accordingly the easiest to implement, so it makes for a good example. In this section, you will learn how to use the types and functions listed above to implement the Metropolis-Hastings sampler using the MCMC interface.\nThe full code for this implementation is housed in AdvancedMH.jl.\n\n\nLet’s begin by importing the relevant libraries. We’ll import AbstractMCMC, which contains the interface framework we’ll fill out. We also need Distributions and Random.\n\n# Import the relevant libraries.\nusing AbstractMCMC: AbstractMCMC\nusing Distributions\nusing Random\n\nAn interface extension (like the one we’re writing right now) typically requires that you overload or implement several functions. Specifically, you should import the functions you intend to overload. This next code block accomplishes that.\nFrom Distributions, we need Sampleable, VariateForm, and ValueSupport, three abstract types that define a distribution. Models in the interface are assumed to be subtypes of Sampleable{VariateForm, ValueSupport}. In this section our model is going be be extremely simple, so we will not end up using these except to make sure that the inference functions are dispatching correctly.\n\n\n\nLet’s begin our sampler definition by defining a sampler called MetropolisHastings which is a subtype of AbstractSampler. Correct typing is very important for proper interface implementation – if you are missing a subtype, your method may not be dispatched to when you call sample.\n\n# Define a sampler type.\nstruct MetropolisHastings{T,D} &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler\n    init_θ::T\n    proposal::D\nend\n\n# Default constructors.\nMetropolisHastings(init_θ::Real) = MetropolisHastings(init_θ, Normal(0, 1))\nfunction MetropolisHastings(init_θ::Vector{&lt;:Real})\n    return MetropolisHastings(init_θ, MvNormal(zero(init_θ), I))\nend\n\nMetropolisHastings\n\n\nAbove, we have defined a sampler that stores the initial parameterization of the prior, and a distribution object from which proposals are drawn. You can have a struct that has no fields, and simply use it for dispatching onto the relevant functions, or you can store a large amount of state information in your sampler.\nThe general intuition for what to store in your sampler struct is that anything you may need to perform inference between samples but you don’t want to store in a transition should go into the sampler struct. It’s the only way you can carry non-sample related state information between step! calls.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to have a model of some kind. A model is a struct that’s a subtype of AbstractModel that contains whatever information is necessary to perform inference on your problem. In our case we want to know the mean and variance parameters for a standard Normal distribution, so we can keep our model to the log density of a Normal.\nNote that we only have to do this because we are not yet integrating the sampler with Turing – Turing has a very sophisticated modelling engine that removes the need to define custom model structs.\n\n# Define a model type. Stores the log density function.\nstruct DensityModel{F&lt;:Function} &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractModel\n    ℓπ::F\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to define some transition which we will return from each step! call. We’ll keep it simple by just defining a wrapper struct that contains the parameter draws and the log density of that draw:\n\n# Create a very basic Transition type, only stores the \n# parameter draws and the log probability of the draw.\nstruct Transition{T,L}\n    θ::T\n    lp::L\nend\n\n# Store the new draw and its log density.\nTransition(model::DensityModel, θ) = Transition(θ, ℓπ(model, θ))\n\nTransition\n\n\nTransition can now store any type of parameter, whether it’s a vector of draws from multiple parameters or a single univariate draw.\n\n\n\nNow it’s time to get into the actual inference. We’ve defined all of the core pieces we need, but we need to implement the step! function which actually performs inference.\nAs a refresher, Metropolis-Hastings implements a very basic algorithm:\n\nPick some initial state, \\theta_0.\nFor t in [1,N], do\n\nGenerate a proposal parameterization \\theta^\\prime_t \\sim q(\\theta^\\prime_t \\mid \\theta_{t-1}).\nCalculate the acceptance probability, \\alpha = \\text{min}\\left[1,\\frac{\\pi(\\theta'_t)}{\\pi(\\theta_{t-1})} \\frac{q(\\theta_{t-1} \\mid \\theta'_t)}{q(\\theta'_t \\mid \\theta_{t-1})}) \\right].\nIf U \\le \\alpha where U \\sim [0,1], then \\theta_t = \\theta'_t. Otherwise, \\theta_t = \\theta_{t-1}.\n\n\nOf course, it’s much easier to do this in the log space, so the acceptance probability is more commonly written as\n\\log \\alpha = \\min\\left[0, \\log \\pi(\\theta'_t) - \\log \\pi(\\theta_{t-1}) + \\log q(\\theta_{t-1} \\mid \\theta^\\prime_t) - \\log q(\\theta\\prime_t \\mid \\theta_{t-1}) \\right].\nIn interface terms, we should do the following:\n\nMake a new transition containing a proposed sample.\nCalculate the acceptance probability.\nIf we accept, return the new transition, otherwise, return the old one.\n\n\n\n\nThe step! function is the function that performs the bulk of your inference. In our case, we will implement two step! functions – one for the very first iteration, and one for every subsequent iteration.\n\n# Define the first step! function, which is called at the \n# beginning of sampling. Return the initial parameter used\n# to define the sampler.\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step!(\n    rng::AbstractRNG,\n    model::DensityModel,\n    spl::MetropolisHastings,\n    N::Integer,\n    ::Nothing;\n    kwargs...,\n)\n    return Transition(model, spl.init_θ)\nend\n\nThe first step! function just packages up the initial parameterization inside the sampler, and returns it. We implicitly accept the very first parameterization.\nThe other step! function performs the usual steps from Metropolis-Hastings. Included are several helper functions, proposal and q, which are designed to replicate the functions in the pseudocode above.\n\nproposal generates a new proposal in the form of a Transition, which can be univariate if the value passed in is univariate, or it can be multivariate if the Transition given is multivariate. Proposals use a basic Normal or MvNormal proposal distribution.\nq returns the log density of one parameterization conditional on another, according to the proposal distribution.\nstep! generates a new proposal, checks the acceptance probability, and then returns either the previous transition or the proposed transition.\n\n\n# Define a function that makes a basic proposal depending on a univariate\n# parameterization or a multivariate parameterization.\nfunction propose(spl::MetropolisHastings, model::DensityModel, θ::Real)\n    return Transition(model, θ + rand(spl.proposal))\nend\nfunction propose(spl::MetropolisHastings, model::DensityModel, θ::Vector{&lt;:Real})\n    return Transition(model, θ + rand(spl.proposal))\nend\nfunction propose(spl::MetropolisHastings, model::DensityModel, t::Transition)\n    return propose(spl, model, t.θ)\nend\n\n# Calculates the probability `q(θ|θcond)`, using the proposal distribution `spl.proposal`.\nq(spl::MetropolisHastings, θ::Real, θcond::Real) = logpdf(spl.proposal, θ - θcond)\nfunction q(spl::MetropolisHastings, θ::Vector{&lt;:Real}, θcond::Vector{&lt;:Real})\n    return logpdf(spl.proposal, θ - θcond)\nend\nq(spl::MetropolisHastings, t1::Transition, t2::Transition) = q(spl, t1.θ, t2.θ)\n\n# Calculate the density of the model given some parameterization.\nℓπ(model::DensityModel, θ) = model.ℓπ(θ)\nℓπ(model::DensityModel, t::Transition) = t.lp\n\n# Define the other step function. Returns a Transition containing\n# either a new proposal (if accepted) or the previous proposal \n# (if not accepted).\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step!(\n    rng::AbstractRNG,\n    model::DensityModel,\n    spl::MetropolisHastings,\n    ::Integer,\n    θ_prev::Transition;\n    kwargs...,\n)\n    # Generate a new proposal.\n    θ = propose(spl, model, θ_prev)\n\n    # Calculate the log acceptance probability.\n    α = ℓπ(model, θ) - ℓπ(model, θ_prev) + q(spl, θ_prev, θ) - q(spl, θ, θ_prev)\n\n    # Decide whether to return the previous θ or the new one.\n    if log(rand(rng)) &lt; min(α, 0.0)\n        return θ\n    else\n        return θ_prev\n    end\nend\n\n\n\n\nIn the default implementation, sample just returns a vector of all transitions. If instead you would like to obtain a Chains object (e.g., to simplify downstream analysis), you have to implement the bundle_samples function as well. It accepts the vector of transitions and returns a collection of samples. Fortunately, our Transition is incredibly simple, and we only need to build a little bit of functionality to accept custom parameter names passed in by the user.\n\n# A basic chains constructor that works with the Transition struct we defined.\nfunction AbstractMCMC.bundle_samples(\n    rng::AbstractRNG,\n    ℓ::DensityModel,\n    s::MetropolisHastings,\n    N::Integer,\n    ts::Vector{&lt;:Transition},\n    chain_type::Type{Any};\n    param_names=missing,\n    kwargs...,\n)\n    # Turn all the transitions into a vector-of-vectors.\n    vals = copy(reduce(hcat, [vcat(t.θ, t.lp) for t in ts])')\n\n    # Check if we received any parameter names.\n    if ismissing(param_names)\n        param_names = [\"Parameter $i\" for i in 1:(length(first(vals)) - 1)]\n    end\n\n    # Add the log density field to the parameter names.\n    push!(param_names, \"lp\")\n\n    # Bundle everything up and return a Chains struct.\n    return Chains(vals, param_names, (internals=[\"lp\"],))\nend\n\nAll done!\nYou can even implement different output formats by implementing bundle_samples for different chain_types, which can be provided as keyword argument to sample. As default sample uses chain_type = Any.\n\n\n\nNow that we have all the pieces, we should test the implementation by defining a model to calculate the mean and variance parameters of a Normal distribution. We can do this by constructing a target density function, providing a sample of data, and then running the sampler with sample.\n\n# Generate a set of data from the posterior we want to estimate.\ndata = rand(Normal(5, 3), 30)\n\n# Define the components of a basic model.\ninsupport(θ) = θ[2] &gt;= 0\ndist(θ) = Normal(θ[1], θ[2])\ndensity(θ) = insupport(θ) ? sum(logpdf.(dist(θ), data)) : -Inf\n\n# Construct a DensityModel.\nmodel = DensityModel(density)\n\n# Set up our sampler with initial parameters.\nspl = MetropolisHastings([0.0, 0.0])\n\n# Sample from the posterior.\nchain = sample(model, spl, 100000; param_names=[\"μ\", \"σ\"])\n\nIf all the interface functions have been extended properly, you should get an output from display(chain) that looks something like this:\nObject of type Chains, with data of type 100000×3×1 Array{Float64,3}\n\nIterations        = 1:100000\nThinning interval = 1\nChains            = 1\nSamples per chain = 100000\ninternals         = lp\nparameters        = μ, σ\n\n2-element Array{ChainDataFrame,1}\n\nSummary Statistics\n\n│ Row │ parameters │ mean    │ std      │ naive_se   │ mcse       │ ess     │ r_hat   │\n│     │ Symbol     │ Float64 │ Float64  │ Float64    │ Float64    │ Any     │ Any     │\n├─────┼────────────┼─────────┼──────────┼────────────┼────────────┼─────────┼─────────┤\n│ 1   │ μ          │ 5.33157 │ 0.854193 │ 0.0027012  │ 0.00893069 │ 8344.75 │ 1.00009 │\n│ 2   │ σ          │ 4.54992 │ 0.632916 │ 0.00200146 │ 0.00534942 │ 14260.8 │ 1.00005 │\n\nQuantiles\n\n│ Row │ parameters │ 2.5%    │ 25.0%   │ 50.0%   │ 75.0%   │ 97.5%   │\n│     │ Symbol     │ Float64 │ Float64 │ Float64 │ Float64 │ Float64 │\n├─────┼────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤\n│ 1   │ μ          │ 3.6595  │ 4.77754 │ 5.33182 │ 5.89509 │ 6.99651 │\n│ 2   │ σ          │ 3.5097  │ 4.09732 │ 4.47805 │ 4.93094 │ 5.96821 │\nIt looks like we’re extremely close to our true parameters of Normal(5,3), though with a fairly high variance due to the low sample size.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen how to implement the sampling interface for general projects.

    "text": "Metropolis-Hastings is often the first sampling method that people are exposed to. It is a very straightforward algorithm and is accordingly the easiest to implement, so it makes for a good example. In this section, you will learn how to use the types and functions listed above to implement the Metropolis-Hastings sampler using the MCMC interface.\nThe full code for this implementation is housed in AdvancedMH.jl.\n\n\nLet’s begin by importing the relevant libraries. We’ll import AbstractMCMC, which contains the interface framework we’ll fill out. We also need Distributions and Random.\n\n# Import the relevant libraries.\nusing AbstractMCMC: AbstractMCMC\nusing Distributions\nusing Random\n\nAn interface extension (like the one we’re writing right now) typically requires that you overload or implement several functions. Specifically, you should import the functions you intend to overload. This next code block accomplishes that.\nFrom Distributions, we need Sampleable, VariateForm, and ValueSupport, three abstract types that define a distribution. Models in the interface are assumed to be subtypes of Sampleable{VariateForm, ValueSupport}. In this section our model is going be be extremely simple, so we will not end up using these except to make sure that the inference functions are dispatching correctly.\n\n\n\nLet’s begin our sampler definition by defining a sampler called MetropolisHastings which is a subtype of AbstractSampler. Correct typing is very important for proper interface implementation – if you are missing a subtype, your method may not be dispatched to when you call sample.\n\n# Define a sampler type.\nstruct MetropolisHastings{T,D} &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler\n    init_θ::T\n    proposal::D\nend\n\n# Default constructors.\nMetropolisHastings(init_θ::Real) = MetropolisHastings(init_θ, Normal(0, 1))\nfunction MetropolisHastings(init_θ::Vector{&lt;:Real})\n    return MetropolisHastings(init_θ, MvNormal(zero(init_θ), I))\nend\n\nMetropolisHastings\n\n\nAbove, we have defined a sampler that stores the initial parameterization of the prior, and a distribution object from which proposals are drawn. You can have a struct that has no fields, and simply use it for dispatching onto the relevant functions, or you can store a large amount of state information in your sampler.\nThe general intuition for what to store in your sampler struct is that anything you may need to perform inference between samples but you don’t want to store in a transition should go into the sampler struct.

Now, \\(y\\) is itself a random variable, and like any other random variable, will have a probability distribution, which we’ll call \\(q(y)\\).\nIn this specific case, the distribution of \\(y\\) is known as a log-normal distribution. For the purposes of this tutorial, let’s implement our own MyLogNormal distribution that we can sample from. (Distributions.jl already defines its own LogNormal, so we have to use a different name.) To do this, we need to overload Base.rand for our new distribution.\n\nstruct MyLogNormal &lt;: Distributions.ContinuousUnivariateDistribution\n    μ::Float64\n    σ::Float64\nend\nMyLogNormal() = MyLogNormal(0.0, 1.0)\n\nfunction Base.rand(rng::Random.AbstractRNG, d::MyLogNormal)\n  exp(rand(rng, Normal(d.μ, d.σ)))\nend\n\nNow we can do the same as above:\n\nsamples_lognormal = rand(MyLogNormal(), 5000)\n# Cut off the tail for clearer visualisation\nhistogram(samples_lognormal, bins=0:0.1:5; xlims=(0, 5))\n\n\n\n\nHow do we implement logpdf for our new distribution, though?

    "text": "The derivative\nThe reason why this doesn’t work is because transforming a (continuous) distribution causes probability density to be stretched and otherwise moved around. For example, in the normal distribution, half of the probability density is between \\(-\\infty\\) and \\(0\\), and half is between \\(0\\) and \\(\\infty\\). When exponentiated (i.e. in the log-normal distribution), the first half of the density is mapped to the interval \\((0, 1)\\), and the second half to \\((1, \\infty)\\).\nThis ‘explanation’ on its own does not really mean much, though. A perhaps more useful approach is to not talk about probability densities, but instead to make it more concrete by relating them to actual probabilities. If we think about the normal distribution as a continuous curve, what the probability density function \\(p(x)\\) really tells us is that: for any two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (where \\(a \\leq b\\)), the probability of drawing a sample between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the corresponding area under the curve, i.e.\n\\[\\int_a^b p(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\\]\nFor example, if \\((a, b) = (-\\infty, \\infty)\\), then the probability of drawing a sample between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 1.\nLet’s say that the probability density function of the log-normal distribution is \\(q(y)\\). Then, the area under the curve between the two points \\(\\exp(a)\\) and \\(\\exp(b)\\) is:\n\\[\\int_{\\exp(a)}^{\\exp(b)} q(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y.\\]\nThis integral should be equal to the one above, because the probability of drawing from \\([a, b]\\) in the original distribution should be the same as the probability of drawing from \\([\\exp(a), \\exp(b)]\\) in the transformed distribution. The question we have to solve here is: how do we find a function \\(q(y)\\) such that this equality holds?\nWe can approach this by making the substitution \\(y = \\exp(x)\\) in the first integral (see Wikipedia for a refresher on substitutions in integrals, if needed). We have that:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\exp(x) = y \\implies \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{y}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\]\nand so\n\\[\\int_{x=a}^{x=b} p(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n  = \\int_{y=\\exp(a)}^{y=\\exp(b)} p(\\log(y)) \\frac{1}{y} \\,\\mathrm{d}y\n  = \\int_{\\exp(a)}^{\\exp(b)} q(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y,\n\\]\nfrom which we can read off \\(q(y) = p(\\log(y)) / y\\).\nIn contrast, when we implemented naive_logpdf\n\nnaive_logpdf(d::MyLogNormal, y) = logpdf(Normal(d.μ, d.σ), log(y))\n\nnaive_logpdf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nthat was the equivalent of saying that \\(q(y) = p(\\log(y))\\). We left out a factor of \\(1/y\\)!\nIndeed, now we can define the correct logpdf function. Since everything is a logarithm here, instead of multiplying by \\(1/y\\) we subtract \\(\\log(y)\\):\n\nDistributions.logpdf(d::MyLogNormal, y) = logpdf(Normal(d.μ, d.σ), log(y)) - log(y)\n\nand check that it works:\n\nprintln(\"Sample   : $(samples_lognormal[1])\")\nprintln(\"Expected : $(logpdf(LogNormal(), samples_lognormal[1]))\")\nprintln(\"Actual   : $(logpdf(MyLogNormal(), samples_lognormal[1]))\")\n\nSample   : 2.2331001636281114\nExpected : -2.0450477723405234\nActual   : -2.0450477723405234\n\n\nThe same process can be applied to any kind of (invertible) transformation. If we have some transformation from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), and the probability density functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(y)\\) respectively, then we have a general formula that:\n\\[q(y) = p(x) \\left| \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\right|.\\]\nIn this case, we had \\(y = \\exp(x)\\), so \\(\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}y = 1/y\\). (This equation is (11.5) in Bishop’s textbook.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe absolute value here takes care of the case where \\(f\\) is a decreasing function, i.e., \\(f(x) &gt; f(y)\\) when \\(x &lt; y\\). You can try this out with the transformation \\(y = -\\exp(x)\\). If \\(a &lt; b\\), then \\(-\\exp(a) &gt; -\\exp(b)\\), and so you will have to swap the integration limits to ensure that the integral comes out positive.\n\n\nNote that \\(\\mathrm{d}y/\\mathrm{d}x\\) is equal to \\((\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}y)^{-1}\\), so the formula above can also be written as:\n\\[q(y) \\left| \\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right| = p(x).\\]",

In this case, we need to extend the rule above by introducing what is known as the Jacobian matrix:\nIn this case, the rule above has to be extended by replacing the derivative \\(\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}y\\) with the determinant of the inverse Jacobian matrix:\n\\[\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial y_1/\\partial x_1 & \\partial y_1/\\partial x_2 \\\\\n\\partial y_2/\\partial x_1 & \\partial y_2/\\partial x_2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nThis allows us to write the direct generalisation as:\n\\[q(y_1, y_2) \\left| \\det(\\mathbf{J}) \\right| = p(x_1, x_2),\\]\nor equivalently,\n\\[q(y_1, y_2) = p(x_1, x_2) \\left| \\det(\\mathbf{J}^{-1}) \\right|.\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{J}^{-1}\\) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. This is the same as equation (11.9) in Bishop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInstead of inverting the original Jacobian matrix to get \\(\\mathbf{J}^{-1}\\), we could also use the Jacobian of the inverse function:\n\\[\\mathbf{J}_\\text{inv} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\partial x_1/\\partial y_1 & \\partial x_1/\\partial y_2 \\\\\n\\partial x_2/\\partial y_1 & \\partial x_2/\\partial y_2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nAs it turns out, these are entirely equivalent: the Jacobian of the inverse function is the inverse of the original Jacobian matrix.\n\n\nThe rest of this section will be devoted to an example to show that this works, and contains some slightly less pretty mathematics. If you are already suitably convinced by this stage, then you can skip the rest of this section. (Or if you prefer something more formal, the Wikipedia article on integration by substitution discusses the multivariate case as well.)\n\nAn example: the Box–Muller transform\nA motivating example where one might like to use a Jacobian is the Box–Muller transform, which is a technique for sampling from a normal distribution.\nThe Box–Muller transform works by first sampling two random variables from the uniform distribution between 0 and 1:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_1 &\\sim U(0, 1) \\\\\nx_2 &\\sim U(0, 1).\n\\end{align}\\]\nBoth of these have a probability density function of \\(p(x) = 1\\) for \\(0 &lt; x \\leq 1\\), and 0 otherwise. Because they are independent, we can write that\n\\[p(x_1, x_2) = p(x_1) p(x_2) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } 0 &lt; x_1 \\leq 1 \\text{ and } 0 &lt; x_2 \\leq 1, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\\]\nThe next step is to perform the transforms\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_1 &= \\sqrt{-2 \\log(x_1)} \\cos(2\\pi x_2); \\\\\ny_2 &= \\sqrt{-2 \\log(x_1)} \\sin(2\\pi x_2),\n\\end{align}\\]\nand it turns out that with these transforms, both \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) are independent and normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, i.e.\n\\[q(y_1, y_2) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_1^2}{2}\\right)} \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_2^2}{2}\\right)}.\\]\nHow can we show that this is the case?\nThere are many ways to work out the required calculus. Some are more elegant and some rather less so! One of the less headache-inducing ways is to define the intermediate variables:\n\\[r = \\sqrt{-2 \\log(x_1)}; \\quad \\theta = 2\\pi x_2,\\]\nfrom which we can see that \\(y_1 = r\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(y_2 = r\\sin\\theta\\), and hence\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_1 &= \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{2}\\right)} = \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_1^2}{2}\\right)}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_2^2}{2}\\right)}; \\\\\nx_2 &= \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\, \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y_2}{y_1}\\right).\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis lets us obtain the requisite partial derivatives in a way that doesn’t involve too much algebra. As an example, we have\n\\[\\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial y_1} = -y_1 \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_1^2}{2}\\right)}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_2^2}{2}\\right)} = -y_1 x_1,\\]\n(where we used the product rule), and\n\\[\\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial y_1} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (y_2/y_1)^2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{y_2}{y_1^2}\\right),\\]\n(where we used the chain rule, and the derivative \\(\\mathrm{d}(\\arctan(a))/\\mathrm{d}a = 1/(1 + a^2)\\)).\nPutting together the Jacobian matrix, we have:\n\\[\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-y_1 x_1 & -y_2 x_1 \\\\\n-cy_2/y_1^2 & c/y_1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\\]\nwhere \\(c = [2\\pi(1 + (y_2/y_1)^2)]^{-1}\\). The determinant of this matrix is\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\det(\\mathbf{J}) &= -cx_1 - cx_1(y_2/y_1)^2 \\\\\n&= -cx_1\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{y_2}{y_1}\\right)^2\\right] \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} x_1 \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_1^2}{2}\\right)}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_2^2}{2}\\right)},\n\\end{align}\\]\nComing right back to our probability density, we have that\n\\[\\begin{align}\nq(y_1, y_2) &= p(x_1, x_2) \\cdot |\\det(\\mathbf{J})| \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_1^2}{2}\\right)}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{y_2^2}{2}\\right)},\n\\end{align}\\]\nas desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe haven’t yet explicitly accounted for the fact that \\(p(x_1, x_2)\\) is 0 if either \\(x_1\\) or \\(x_2\\) are outside the range \\((0, 1]\\). For example, if this constraint on \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) were to result in inaccessible values of \\(y_1\\) or \\(y_2\\), then \\(q(y_1, y_2)\\) should be 0 for those values. Formally, for the transformation \\(f: X \\to Y\\) where \\(X\\) is the unit square (i.e. \\(0 &lt; x_1, x_2 \\leq 1\\)), \\(q(y_1, y_2)\\) should only take the above value for the image of \\(f\\), and anywhere outside of the image it should be 0.\nIn our case, the \\(\\log(x_1)\\) term in the transform varies between 0 and \\(\\infty\\), and the \\(\\cos(2\\pi x_2)\\) term ranges from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\). Hence \\(y_1\\), which is the product of these two terms, ranges from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), and likewise for \\(y_2\\). So the image of \\(f\\) is the entire real plane, and we don’t have to worry about this.\n\n\nHaving seen the theory that underpins how distributions can be transformed, let’s now turn to how this is implemented in the Turing ecosystem.",

That is to say, if we have two sets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then a bijection maps each element of \\(X\\) to a unique element of \\(Y\\). To return to our univariate example, where we transformed \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) using \\(y = \\exp(x)\\), the exponentiation function is a bijection because every value of \\(x\\) maps to one unique value of \\(y\\). The input set (the domain) is \\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\), and the output set (the codomain) is \\((0, \\infty)\\). (Here, \\((a, b)\\) denotes the open interval from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) but excluding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.)\nSince bijections are a one-to-one mapping between elements, we can also reverse the direction of this mapping to create an inverse function. In the case of \\(y = \\exp(x)\\), the inverse function is \\(x = \\log(y)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTechnically, the bijections in Bijectors.jl are functions \\(f: X \\to Y\\) for which:\n\n\\(f\\) is continuously differentiable, i.e. the derivative \\(\\mathrm{d}f(x)/\\mathrm{d}x\\) exists and is continuous (over the domain of interest \\(X\\));\nIf \\(f^{-1}: Y \\to X\\) is the inverse of \\(f\\), then that is also continuously differentiable (over its own domain, i.e. \\(Y\\)).\n\nThe technical mathematical term for this is a diffeomorphism (Wikipedia), but we call them ‘bijectors’.\nWhen thinking about continuous differentiability, it’s important to be conscious of the domains or codomains that we care about. For example, taking the inverse function \\(\\log(y)\\) from above, its derivative is \\(1/y\\), which is not continuous at \\(y = 0\\). However, we specified that the bijection \\(y = \\exp(x)\\) maps values of \\(x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\) to \\(y \\in (0, \\infty)\\), so the point \\(y = 0\\) is not within the domain of the inverse function.\n\n\nSpecifically, one of the primary purposes of Bijectors.jl is to construct bijections which map constrained distributions to unconstrained ones. For example, the log-normal distribution which we saw in the previous page is constrained: its support, i.e. the range over which \\(p(x) &gt; 0\\), is \\((0, \\infty)\\). However, we can transform that to an unconstrained distribution (the normal distribution) using the transformation \\(y = \\log(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBijectors.jl, as well as DynamicPPL (which we’ll come to later), can work with a much broader class of bijective transformations of variables, not just ones that go to the entire real line. But for the purposes of MCMC, unconstraining is the most common transformation, so we’ll stick with that terminology.\n\n\nThe bijector function, when applied to a distribution, returns a bijection \\(f\\) that can be used to map the constrained distribution to an unconstrained one. Unsurprisingly, for the log-normal distribution, the bijection is (a broadcasted version of) the \\(\\log\\) function.\n\nimport Bijectors as B\n\nf = B.bijector(LogNormal())\n\n(::Base.Fix1{typeof(broadcast), typeof(log)}) (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWe can apply this transformation to samples from the original distribution, for example:\n\nsamples_lognormal = rand(LogNormal(), 5)\n\nsamples_normal = f(samples_lognormal)\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n  0.07200886749732066\n -0.07404375655951738\n  0.6327762377562545\n -0.9799776018729268\n  1.6115229499167665\n\n\nWe can also obtain the inverse of a bijection, \\(f^{-1}\\):\n\nf_inv = B.inverse(f)\n\nf_inv(samples_normal) == samples_lognormal\n\ntrue\n\n\nWe know that the transformation \\(y = \\log(x)\\) changes the log-normal distribution to the normal distribution. Bijectors.jl also gives us a way to access that transformed distribution:\n\ntransformed_dist = B.transformed(LogNormal(), f)\n\nBijectors.UnivariateTransformed{Distributions.LogNormal{Float64}, Base.Fix1{typeof(broadcast), typeof(log)}}(\ndist: Distributions.LogNormal{Float64}(μ=0.0, σ=1.0)\ntransform: Base.Fix1{typeof(broadcast), typeof(log)}(broadcast, log)\n)\n\n\nThis type doesn’t immediately look like a Normal(), but it behaves in exactly the same way. For example, we can sample from it and plot a histogram:\n\nsamples_plot = rand(transformed_dist, 5000)\nhistogram(samples_plot, bins=50)\n\n\n\n\nWe can also obtain the logpdf of the transformed distribution and check that it is the same as that of a normal distribution:\n\nprintln(\"Sample:   $(samples_plot[1])\")\nprintln(\"Expected: $(logpdf(Normal(), samples_plot[1]))\")\nprintln(\"Actual:   $(logpdf(transformed_dist, samples_plot[1]))\")\n\nSample:   -0.2031149013821452\nExpected: -0.9395663647864121\nActual:   -0.9395663647864121\n\n\nGiven the discussion in the previous sections, you might not be surprised to find that the logpdf of the transformed distribution is implemented using the Jacobian of the transformation. In particular, it directly uses the formula\n\\[\\log(q(\\mathbf{y})) = \\log(p(\\mathbf{x})) - \\log(|\\det(\\mathbf{J})|).\\]\nYou can access \\(\\log(|\\det(\\mathbf{J})|)\\) (evaluated at the point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)) using the logabsdetjac function:\n\n# Reiterating the setup, just to be clear\noriginal_dist = LogNormal()\nx = rand(original_dist)\nf = B.bijector(original_dist)\ny = f(x)\ntransformed_dist = B.transformed(LogNormal(), f)\n\nprintln(\"log(q(y))     : $(logpdf(transformed_dist, y))\")\nprintln(\"log(p(x))     : $(logpdf(original_dist, x))\")\nprintln(\"log(|det(J)|) : $(B.logabsdetjac(f, x))\")\n\nlog(q(y))     : -0.9258400203646245\nlog(p(x))     : -0.8083539602557612\nlog(|det(J)|) : 0.11748606010886327\n\n\nfrom which you can see that the equation above holds.

Return the new value, plus a flag to indicate whether\n# the new value was in bounds.\nfunction mh_step(logp, x, in_bounds)\n    x_proposed = rand(Normal(x, 1))\n    in_bounds(x_proposed) || return (x, false)  # bounds check\n    acceptance_logp = logp(x_proposed) - logp(x)\n    return if log(rand()) &lt; acceptance_logp\n        (x_proposed, true)  # successful step\n    else\n        (x, true)  # failed step\n    end\nend\n\n# Run a random walk Metropolis sampler.\n# `logp`      : a function that takes `x` and returns the log pdf of the\n#               distribution we're trying to sample from (up to a constant\n#               additive factor)\n# `n_samples` : the number of samples to draw\n# `in_bounds` : a function that takes `x` and returns whether `x` is within\n#               the support of the distribution\n# `x0`        : the initial value\n# Returns a vector of samples, plus the number of times we went out of bounds.\nfunction mh(logp, n_samples, in_bounds; x0=1.0)\n    samples = [x0]\n    x = x0\n    n_out_of_bounds = 0\n    for _ in 2:n_samples\n        x, inb = mh_step(logp, x, in_bounds)\n        if !inb\n            n_out_of_bounds += 1\n        end\n        push!(samples, x)\n    end\n    return (samples, n_out_of_bounds)\nend\n\nmh (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the MH algorithm, we technically do not need to explicitly check the proposal, because for any \\(x \\leq 0\\), we have that \\(p(x) = 0\\); thus, the acceptance probability will be zero. However, doing so here allows us to track how often this happens, and also illustrates the general principle of handling constraints by rejection.\n\n\nNow to actually perform the sampling:\n\nlogp(x) = logpdf(LogNormal(), x)\nsamples, n_out_of_bounds = mh(logp, 10000, x -&gt; x &gt; 0)\nhistogram(samples, bins=0:0.1:5; xlims=(0, 5))\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know that this has sampled correctly? For one, we can check that the mean of the samples are what we expect them to be. From Wikipedia, the mean of a log-normal distribution is given by \\(\\exp[\\mu + (\\sigma^2/2)]\\). For our log-normal distribution, we set \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1\\), so:\n\nprintln(\"expected mean: $(exp(0 + (1^2/2)))\")\nprintln(\"  actual mean: $(mean(samples))\")\n\nexpected mean: 1.6487212707001282\n  actual mean: 1.3347941996487\n\n\n\n\nMetropolis with transformation\nThe issue with this is that many of the sampling steps are unproductive, in that they bring us to the region of \\(x \\leq 0\\) and get rejected:\n\nprintln(\"went out of bounds $n_out_of_bounds/10000 times\")\n\nwent out of bounds 1870/10000 times\n\n\nAnd this could have been even worse if we had chosen a wider proposal distribution in the Metropolis step, or if the support of the distribution was narrower! In general, we probably don’t want to have to re-parameterise our proposal distribution each time we sample from a distribution with different constraints.\nThis is where the transformation functions from Bijectors.jl come in: we can use them to map the distribution to an unconstrained one and sample from that instead. Since the sampler only ever sees an unconstrained distribution, it doesn’t have to worry about checking for bounds.\nTo make this happen, instead of passing \\(\\log(p(x))\\) to the sampler, we pass \\(\\log(q(y))\\). This can be obtained using the Bijectors.logpdf_with_trans function that was introduced above.\n\nd = LogNormal()\nf = B.bijector(d)     # Transformation function\nf_inv = B.inverse(f)  # Inverse transformation function\nfunction logq(y)\n    x = f_inv(y)\n    return B.logpdf_with_trans(d, x, true)\nend\nsamples_transformed, n_oob_transformed = mh(logq, 10000, x -&gt; true);\n\nNow, this process gives us samples that have been transformed, so we need to un-transform them to get the samples from the original distribution:\n\nsamples_untransformed = f_inv(samples_transformed)\nhistogram(samples_untransformed, bins=0:0.1:5; xlims=(0, 5))\n\n\n\n\nWe can check the mean of the samples too, to see that it is what we expect:\n\nprintln(\"expected mean: $(exp(0 + (1^2/2)))\")\nprintln(\"  actual mean: $(mean(samples_untransformed))\")\n\nexpected mean: 1.6487212707001282\n  actual mean: 1.7184757306010636\n\n\nOn top of that, we can also verify that we don’t ever go out of bounds:\n\nprintln(\"went out of bounds $n_oob_transformed/10000 times\")\n\nwent out of bounds 0/10000 times\n\n\n\n\nWhich one is better?\nIn the subsections above, we’ve seen two different methods of sampling from a constrained distribution:\n\nSample directly from the distribution and reject any samples outside of its support.\nTransform the distribution to an unconstrained one and sample from that instead.\n\n(Note that both of these methods are applicable to other samplers as well, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.)\nOf course, a natural question to then ask is which one of these is better!\nOne option might be look at the sample means above to see which one is ‘closer’ to the expected mean. However, that’s not a very robust method because the sample mean is itself random, and if we were to use a different random seed we might well reach a different conclusion.\nAnother possibility we could look at the number of times the sample was rejected. Does a lower rejection rate (as in the transformed case) imply that the method is better? As it happens, this might seem like an intuitive conclusion, but it’s not necessarily the case: for example, the sampling in unconstrained space could be much less efficient, such that even though we’re not rejecting samples, the ones that we do get are overly correlated and thus not representative of the distribution.\nA robust comparison would involve performing both methods many times and seeing how reliable the sample mean is.\n\nfunction get_sample_mean(; transform)\n    if transform\n       # Sample from transformed distribution\n       samples = f_inv(first(mh(logq, 10000, x -&gt; true)))\n    else\n       # Sample from original distribution and reject if out of bounds\n       samples = first(mh(logp, 10000, x -&gt; x &gt; 0))\n    end\n    return mean(samples)\nend\n\nget_sample_mean (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nmeans_with_rejection = [get_sample_mean(; transform=false) for _ in 1:1000]\nmean(means_with_rejection), var(means_with_rejection)\n\n(1.652032684314151, 0.30454613712270745)\n\n\n\nmeans_with_transformation = [get_sample_mean(; transform=true) for _ in 1:1000]\nmean(means_with_transformation), var(means_with_transformation)\n\n(1.6489347143276902, 0.003945513418875533)\n\n\nWe can see from this small study that although both methods give us the correct mean (on average), the method with the transformation is more reliable, in that the variance is much lower!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could also try to directly measure how correlated the samples are. One way to do this is to calculate the effective sample size (ESS), which is described in the Stan documentation, and implemented in MCMCChains.jl. A larger ESS implies that the samples are less correlated, and thus more representative of the underlying distribution:\n\nusing MCMCChains: Chains, ess\n\nrejection = first(mh(logp, 10000, x -&gt; x &gt; 0))\ntransformation = f_inv(first(mh(logq, 10000, x -&gt; true)))\nchn = Chains(hcat(rejection, transformation), [:rejection, :transformation])\ness(chn)\n\n\nESS\n      parameters         ess   ess_per_sec\n          Symbol     Float64       Missing\n\n       rejection    503.4349       missing\n  transformation   1106.6909       missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens without the Jacobian?\nIn the transformation method above, we used Bijectors.logpdf_with_trans to calculate the log probability density of the transformed distribution. This function makes sure to include the Jacobian term when performing the transformation, and this is what makes sure that when we un-transform the samples, we get the correct distribution.\nThe next code block shows what happens if we don’t include the Jacobian term. In this logq_wrong, we’ve un-transformed y to x and calculated the logpdf with respect to its original distribution. This is exactly the same mistake that we made at the start of this article with naive_logpdf.\n\nfunction logq_wrong(y)\n    x = f_inv(y)\n    return logpdf(d, x)  # no Jacobian term!\nend\nsamples_questionable, _ = mh(logq_wrong, 100000, x -&gt; true)\nsamples_questionable_untransformed = f_inv(samples_questionable)\n\nprintln(\"mean: $(mean(samples_questionable_untransformed))\")\n\nmean: 0.5919166187308191\n\n\nYou can see that even though we used ten times more samples, the mean is quite wrong, which implies that our samples are not being drawn from the correct distribution.\nIn the next page, we’ll see how to use these transformations in the context of a probabilistic programming language, paying particular attention to their handling in DynamicPPL.",

    "text": "In this tutorial we develop a very simple probabilistic programming language. The implementation is similar to DynamicPPL. This is intentional as we want to demonstrate some key ideas from Turing’s internal implementation.\nTo make things easy to understand and to implement we restrict our language to a very simple subset of the language that Turing actually supports. Defining an accurate syntax description is not our goal here, instead, we give a simple example and all similar programs should work.\n\nConsider a probabilistic model defined by\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na &\\sim \\operatorname{Normal}(0.5, 1^2) \\\\\nb &\\sim \\operatorname{Normal}(a, 2^2) \\\\\nx &\\sim \\operatorname{Normal}(b, 0.5^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe assume that x is data, i.e., an observed variable. In our small language this model will be defined as\n\n@mini_model function m(x)\n    a ~ Normal(0.5, 1)\n    b ~ Normal(a, 2)\n    x ~ Normal(b, 0.5)\n    return nothing\nend\n\nSpecifically, we demand that\n\nall observed variables are arguments of the program,\nthe model definition does not contain any control flow,\nall variables are scalars, and\nthe function returns nothing.\n\nFirst, we import some required packages:\n\nusing MacroTools, Distributions, Random, AbstractMCMC, MCMCChains\n\nBefore getting to the actual “compiler”, we first build the data structure for the program trace. A program trace for a probabilistic programming language needs to at least record the values of stochastic variables and their log-probabilities.\n\nstruct VarInfo{V,L}\n    values::V\n    logps::L\nend\n\nVarInfo() = VarInfo(Dict{Symbol,Float64}(), Dict{Symbol,Float64}())\n\nfunction Base.setindex!(varinfo::VarInfo, (value, logp), var_id)\n    varinfo.values[var_id] = value\n    varinfo.logps[var_id] = logp\n    return varinfo\nend\n\nInternally, our probabilistic programming language works with two main functions:\n\nassume for sampling unobserved variables and computing their log-probabilities, and\nobserve for computing log-probabilities of observed variables (but not sampling them).\n\nFor different inference algorithms we may have to use different sampling procedures and different log-probability computations. For instance, in some cases we might want to sample all variables from their prior distributions and in other cases we might only want to compute the log-likelihood of the observations based on a given set of values for the unobserved variables. Thus depending on the inference algorithm we want to use different assume and observe implementations. We can achieve this by providing this context information as a function argument to assume and observe.\nNote: Although the context system in this tutorial is inspired by DynamicPPL, it is very simplistic. We expand this mini Turing example in the contexts tutorial with some more complexity, to illustrate how and why contexts are central to Turing’s design. For the full details one still needs to go to the actual source of DynamicPPL though.\nHere we can see the implementation of a sampler that draws values of unobserved variables from the prior and computes the log-probability for every variable.\n\nstruct SamplingContext{S&lt;:AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler,R&lt;:Random.AbstractRNG}\n    rng::R\n    sampler::S\nend\n\nstruct PriorSampler &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler end\n\nfunction observe(context::SamplingContext, varinfo, dist, var_id, var_value)\n    logp = logpdf(dist, var_value)\n    varinfo[var_id] = (var_value, logp)\n    return nothing\nend\n\nfunction assume(context::SamplingContext{PriorSampler}, varinfo, dist, var_id)\n    sample = Random.rand(context.rng, dist)\n    logp = logpdf(dist, sample)\n    varinfo[var_id] = (sample, logp)\n    return sample\nend;\n\nNext we define the “compiler” for our simple programming language. The term compiler is actually a bit misleading here since its only purpose is to transform the function definition in the @mini_model macro by\n\nadding the context information (context) and the tracing data structure (varinfo) as additional arguments, and\nreplacing tildes with calls to assume and observe.\n\nAfterwards, as usual the Julia compiler will just-in-time compile the model function when it is called.\nThe manipulation of Julia expressions is an advanced part of the Julia language. The Julia documentation provides an introduction to and more details about this so-called metaprogramming.\n\nmacro mini_model(expr)\n    return esc(mini_model(expr))\nend\n\nfunction mini_model(expr)\n    # Split the function definition into a dictionary with its name, arguments, body etc.\n    def = MacroTools.splitdef(expr)\n\n    # Replace tildes in the function body with calls to `assume` or `observe`\n    def[:body] = MacroTools.postwalk(def[:body]) do sub_expr\n        if MacroTools.@capture(sub_expr, var_ ~ dist_)\n            if var in def[:args]\n                # If the variable is an argument of the model function, it is observed\n                return :($(observe)(context, varinfo, $dist, $(Meta.quot(var)), $var))\n            else\n                # Otherwise it is unobserved\n                return :($var = $(assume)(context, varinfo, $dist, $(Meta.quot(var))))\n            end\n        else\n            return sub_expr\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add `context` and `varinfo` arguments to the model function\n    def[:args] = vcat(:varinfo, :context, def[:args])\n\n    # Reassemble the function definition from its name, arguments, body etc.\n    return MacroTools.combinedef(def)\nend;\n\nFor inference, we make use of the AbstractMCMC interface. It provides a default implementation of a sample function for sampling a Markov chain. The default implementation already supports e.g. sampling of multiple chains in parallel, thinning of samples, or discarding initial samples.\nThe AbstractMCMC interface requires us to at least\n\ndefine a model that is a subtype of AbstractMCMC.AbstractModel,\ndefine a sampler that is a subtype of AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler,\nimplement AbstractMCMC.step for our model and sampler.\n\nThus here we define a MiniModel model. In this model we store the model function and the observed data.\n\nstruct MiniModel{F,D} &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractModel\n    f::F\n    data::D # a NamedTuple of all the data\nend\n\nIn the Turing compiler, the model-specific DynamicPPL.Model is constructed automatically when calling the model function. But for the sake of simplicity here we construct the model manually.\nTo illustrate probabilistic inference with our mini language we implement an extremely simplistic Random-Walk Metropolis-Hastings sampler. We hard-code the proposal step as part of the sampler and only allow normal distributions with zero mean and fixed standard deviation. The Metropolis-Hastings sampler in Turing is more flexible.\n\nstruct MHSampler{T&lt;:Real} &lt;: AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler\n    sigma::T\nend\n\nMHSampler() = MHSampler(1)\n\nfunction assume(context::SamplingContext{&lt;:MHSampler}, varinfo, dist, var_id)\n    sampler = context.sampler\n    old_value = varinfo.values[var_id]\n\n    # propose a random-walk step, i.e, add the current value to a random\n    # value sampled from a Normal distribution centered at 0\n    value = rand(context.rng, Normal(old_value, sampler.sigma))\n    logp = Distributions.logpdf(dist, value)\n    varinfo[var_id] = (value, logp)\n\n    return value\nend;\n\nWe need to define two step functions, one for the first step and the other for the following steps. In the first step we sample values from the prior distributions and in the following steps we sample with the random-walk proposal. The two functions are identified by the different arguments they take.\n\n# The fist step: Sampling from the prior distributions\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG, model::MiniModel, sampler::MHSampler; kwargs...\n)\n    vi = VarInfo()\n    ctx = SamplingContext(rng, PriorSampler())\n    model.f(vi, ctx, values(model.data)...)\n    return vi, vi\nend\n\n# The following steps: Sampling with random-walk proposal\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    model::MiniModel,\n    sampler::MHSampler,\n    prev_state::VarInfo; # is just the old trace\n    kwargs...,\n)\n    vi = prev_state\n    new_vi = deepcopy(vi)\n    ctx = SamplingContext(rng, sampler)\n    model.f(new_vi, ctx, values(model.data)...)\n\n    # Compute log acceptance probability\n    # Since the proposal is symmetric the computation can be simplified\n    logα = sum(values(new_vi.logps)) - sum(values(vi.logps))\n\n    # Accept proposal with computed acceptance probability\n    if -randexp(rng) &lt; logα\n        return new_vi, new_vi\n    else\n        return prev_state, prev_state\n    end\nend;\n\nTo make it easier to analyze the samples and compare them with results from Turing, additionally we define a version of AbstractMCMC.bundle_samples for our model and sampler that returns a MCMCChains.Chains object of samples.\n\nfunction AbstractMCMC.bundle_samples(\n    samples, model::MiniModel, ::MHSampler, ::Any, ::Type{Chains}; kwargs...\n)\n    # We get a vector of traces\n    values = [sample.values for sample in samples]\n    params = [key for key in keys(values[1]) if key ∉ keys(model.data)]\n    vals = reduce(hcat, [value[p] for value in values] for p in params)\n    # Composing the `Chains` data-structure, of which analyzing infrastructure is provided\n    chains = Chains(vals, params)\n    return chains\nend;\n\nLet us check how our mini probabilistic programming language works.

    "text": "Step 2: Generate the body of the internal model function\nIn a second step, DynamicPPL.generate_mainbody generates the main part of the transformed function body using the user-provided function body and the provided function arguments, without default values, for figuring out if a variable denotes an observation or a random variable. Hereby the function DynamicPPL.generate_tilde replaces the L ~ R lines in the model and the function DynamicPPL.generate_dot_tilde replaces the @. L ~ R and L .~ R lines in the model.\nIn the above example, p[1] ~ InverseGamma(2, 3) is replaced with something similar to\n\n#= REPL[25]:6 =#\nbegin\n    var\"##tmpright#323\" = InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    var\"##tmpright#323\" isa Union{Distribution,AbstractVector{&lt;:Distribution}} || throw(\n        ArgumentError(\n            \"Right-hand side of a ~ must be subtype of Distribution or a vector of Distributions.\",\n        ),\n    )\n    var\"##vn#325\" = (DynamicPPL.VarName)(:p, ((1,),))\n    var\"##inds#326\" = ((1,),)\n    p[1] = (DynamicPPL.tilde_assume)(\n        _rng,\n        _context,\n        _sampler,\n        var\"##tmpright#323\",\n        var\"##vn#325\",\n        var\"##inds#326\",\n        _varinfo,\n    )\nend\n\nHere the first line is a so-called line number node that enables more helpful error messages by providing users with the exact location of the error in their model definition. Then the right hand side (RHS) of the ~ is assigned to a variable (with an automatically generated name). We check that the RHS is a distribution or an array of distributions, otherwise an error is thrown. Next we extract a compact representation of the variable with its name and index (or indices). Finally, the ~ expression is replaced with a call to DynamicPPL.tilde_assume since the compiler figured out that p[1] is a random variable using the following heuristic:\n\nIf the symbol on the LHS of ~, :p in this case, is not among the arguments to the model, (:x, :y, :T) in this case, it is a random variable.\nIf the symbol on the LHS of ~, :p in this case, is among the arguments to the model but has a value of missing, it is a random variable.\nIf the value of the LHS of ~, p[1] in this case, is missing, then it is a random variable.\nOtherwise, it is treated as an observation.\n\nThe DynamicPPL.tilde_assume function takes care of sampling the random variable, if needed, and updating its value and the accumulated log joint probability in the _varinfo object. If L ~ R is an observation, DynamicPPL.tilde_observe is called with the same arguments except the random number generator _rng (since observations are never sampled).\nA similar transformation is performed for expressions of the form @. L ~ R and L .~ R. For instance, @. x[1:2] ~ Normal(p[2], sqrt(p[1])) is replaced with\n\n#= REPL[25]:8 =#\nbegin\n    var\"##tmpright#331\" = Normal.(p[2], sqrt.(p[1]))\n    var\"##tmpright#331\" isa Union{Distribution,AbstractVector{&lt;:Distribution}} || throw(\n        ArgumentError(\n            \"Right-hand side of a ~ must be subtype of Distribution or a vector of Distributions.\",\n        ),\n    )\n    var\"##vn#333\" = (DynamicPPL.VarName)(:x, ((1:2,),))\n    var\"##inds#334\" = ((1:2,),)\n    var\"##isassumption#335\" = begin\n        let var\"##vn#336\" = (DynamicPPL.VarName)(:x, ((1:2,),))\n            if !((DynamicPPL.inargnames)(var\"##vn#336\", _model)) ||\n                (DynamicPPL.inmissings)(var\"##vn#336\", _model)\n                true\n            else\n                x[1:2] === missing\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    if var\"##isassumption#335\"\n        x[1:2] .= (DynamicPPL.dot_tilde_assume)(\n            _rng,\n            _context,\n            _sampler,\n            var\"##tmpright#331\",\n            x[1:2],\n            var\"##vn#333\",\n            var\"##inds#334\",\n            _varinfo,\n        )\n    else\n        (DynamicPPL.dot_tilde_observe)(\n            _context,\n            _sampler,\n            var\"##tmpright#331\",\n            x[1:2],\n            var\"##vn#333\",\n            var\"##inds#334\",\n            _varinfo,\n        )\n    end\nend\n\nThe main difference in the expanded code between L ~ R and @. L ~ R is that the former doesn’t assume L to be defined, it can be a new Julia variable in the scope, while the latter assumes L already exists. Moreover, DynamicPPL.dot_tilde_assume and DynamicPPL.dot_tilde_observe are called instead of DynamicPPL.tilde_assume and DynamicPPL.tilde_observe.",

    "text": "Overview\nVarInfo is the data structure in Turing that facilitates tracking random variables and certain metadata about them that are required for sampling. For instance, the distribution of every random variable is stored in VarInfo because we need to know the support of every random variable when sampling using HMC for example. Random variables whose distributions have a constrained support are transformed using a bijector from Bijectors.jl so that the sampling happens in the unconstrained space. Different samplers require different metadata about the random variables.\nThe definition of VarInfo in Turing is:\n\nstruct VarInfo{Tmeta, Tlogp} &lt;: AbstractVarInfo\n    metadata::Tmeta\n    logp::Base.RefValue{Tlogp}\n    num_produce::Base.RefValue{Int}\nend\n\nBased on the type of metadata, the VarInfo is either aliased UntypedVarInfo or TypedVarInfo. metadata can be either a subtype of the union type Metadata or a NamedTuple of multiple such subtypes. Let vi be an instance of VarInfo. If vi isa VarInfo{&lt;:Metadata}, then it is called an UntypedVarInfo. If vi isa VarInfo{&lt;:NamedTuple}, then vi.metadata would be a NamedTuple mapping each symbol in P to an instance of Metadata. vi would then be called a TypedVarInfo. The other fields of VarInfo include logp which is used to accumulate the log probability or log probability density of the variables in P and D. num_produce keeps track of how many observations have been made in the model so far. This is incremented when running a ~ statement when the symbol on the LHS is in D.",

    "text": "Metadata\nThe Metadata struct stores some metadata about the random variables sampled. This helps query certain information about a variable such as: its distribution, which samplers sample this variable, its value and whether this value is transformed to real space or not. Let md be an instance of Metadata:\n\nmd.vns is the vector of all VarName instances. Let vn be an arbitrary element of md.vns\nmd.idcs is the dictionary that maps each VarName instance to its index in md.vns, md.ranges, md.dists, md.orders and md.flags.\nmd.vns[md.idcs[vn]] == vn.\nmd.dists[md.idcs[vn]] is the distribution of vn.\nmd.gids[md.idcs[vn]] is the set of algorithms used to sample vn. This was used by the Gibbs sampler. Since Turing v0.36 it is unused and will eventually be deleted.\nmd.orders[md.idcs[vn]] is the number of observe statements before vn is sampled.\nmd.ranges[md.idcs[vn]] is the index range of vn in md.vals.\nmd.vals[md.ranges[md.idcs[vn]]] is the linearized vector of values of corresponding to vn.\nmd.flags is a dictionary of true/false flags. md.flags[flag][md.idcs[vn]] is the value of flag corresponding to vn.\n\nNote that in order to make md::Metadata type stable, all the md.vns must have the same symbol and distribution type. However, one can have a single Julia variable, e.g. x, that is a matrix or a hierarchical array sampled in partitions, e.g. x[1][:] ~ MvNormal(zeros(2), I); x[2][:] ~ MvNormal(ones(2), I). The symbol x can still be managed by a single md::Metadata without hurting the type stability since all the distributions on the RHS of ~ are of the same type.\nHowever, in Turing models one cannot have this restriction, so we must use a type unstable Metadata if we want to use one Metadata instance for the whole model. This is what UntypedVarInfo does. A type unstable Metadata will still work but will have inferior performance.\nTo strike a balance between flexibility and performance when constructing the spl::Sampler instance, the model is first run by sampling the parameters in P from their priors using an UntypedVarInfo, i.e. a type unstable Metadata is used for all the variables. Then once all the symbols and distribution types have been identified, a vi::TypedVarInfo is constructed where vi.metadata is a NamedTuple mapping each symbol in P to a specialized instance of Metadata. So as long as each symbol in P is sampled from only one type of distributions, vi::TypedVarInfo will have fully concretely typed fields which brings out the peak performance of Julia.",

We test on Linux (x64), macOS (Apple Silicon), and Windows (x64). The Turing developer team will prioritise fixing issues on these platforms and versions.\nIf you run into a problem on a different version (e.g. older patch releases) or platforms (e.g. 32-bit), please do feel free to post an issue!

    "text": "Simple State Detection\nIn this example, we’ll use something where the states and emission parameters are straightforward.\n\n# Define the emission parameter.\ny = [fill(1.0, 6)..., fill(2.0, 6)..., fill(3.0, 7)...,\n  fill(2.0, 4)..., fill(1.0, 7)...]\nN = length(y);\nK = 3;\n\n# Plot the data we just made.\nplot(y; xlim=(0, 30), ylim=(-1, 5), size=(500, 250), legend = false)\nscatter!(y, color = :blue; xlim=(0, 30), ylim=(-1, 5), size=(500, 250), legend = false)\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that we have three states, one for each height of the plot (1, 2, 3). This height is also our emission parameter, so state one produces a value of one, state two produces a value of two, and so on.\nUltimately, we would like to understand three major parameters:\n\nThe transition matrix. This is a matrix that assigns a probability of switching from one state to any other state, including the state that we are already in.\nThe emission parameters, which describes a typical value emitted by some state. In the plot above, the emission parameter for state one is simply one.\nThe state sequence is our understanding of what state we were actually in when we observed some data. This is very important in more sophisticated HMMs, where the emission value does not equal our state.\n\nWith this in mind, let’s set up our model. We are going to use some of our knowledge as modelers to provide additional information about our system. This takes the form of the prior on our emission parameter.\n\\[\nm_i \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(i, 0.5) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad m = \\{1,2,3\\}\n\\]\nSimply put, this says that we expect state one to emit values in a Normally distributed manner, where the mean of each state’s emissions is that state’s value. The variance of 0.5 helps the model converge more quickly — consider the case where we have a variance of 1 or 2. In this case, the likelihood of observing a 2 when we are in state 1 is actually quite high, as it is within a standard deviation of the true emission value. Applying the prior that we are likely to be tightly centered around the mean prevents our model from being too confused about the state that is generating our observations.\nThe priors on our transition matrix are noninformative, using T[i] ~ Dirichlet(ones(K)/K). The Dirichlet prior used in this way assumes that the state is likely to change to any other state with equal probability. As we’ll see, this transition matrix prior will be overwritten as we observe data.\n\n# Turing model definition.\n@model function BayesHmm(y, K)\n    # Get observation length.\n    N = length(y)\n\n    # State sequence.\n    s = zeros(Int, N)\n\n    # Emission matrix.\n    m = Vector(undef, K)\n\n    # Transition matrix.\n    T = Vector{Vector}(undef, K)\n\n    # Assign distributions to each element\n    # of the transition matrix and the\n    # emission matrix.\n    for i in 1:K\n        T[i] ~ Dirichlet(ones(K) / K)\n        m[i] ~ Normal(i, 0.5)\n    end\n\n    # Observe each point of the input.\n    s[1] ~ Categorical(K)\n    y[1] ~ Normal(m[s[1]], 0.1)\n\n    for i in 2:N\n        s[i] ~ Categorical(vec(T[s[i - 1]]))\n        y[i] ~ Normal(m[s[i]], 0.1)\n    end\nend;\n\nWe will use a combination of two samplers (HMC and Particle Gibbs) by passing them to the Gibbs sampler. The Gibbs sampler allows for compositional inference, where we can utilize different samplers on different parameters. (For API details of these samplers, please see Turing.jl’s API documentation.)\nIn this case, we use HMC for m and T, representing the emission and transition matrices respectively. We use the Particle Gibbs sampler for s, the state sequence. You may wonder why it is that we are not assigning s to the HMC sampler, and why it is that we need compositional Gibbs sampling at all.\nThe parameter s is not a continuous variable. It is a vector of integers, and thus Hamiltonian methods like HMC and NUTS won’t work correctly. Gibbs allows us to apply the right tools to the best effect. If you are a particularly advanced user interested in higher performance, you may benefit from setting up your Gibbs sampler to use different automatic differentiation backends for each parameter space.\nTime to run our sampler.\n\ng = Gibbs((:m, :T) =&gt; HMC(0.01, 50), :s =&gt; PG(120))\nchn = sample(BayesHmm(y, 3), g, 1000)\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×45×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:1000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 1511.71 seconds\nCompute duration  = 1511.71 seconds\nparameters        = T[1][1], T[1][2], T[1][3], m[1], T[2][1], T[2][2], T[2][3], m[2], T[3][1], T[3][2], T[3][3], m[3], s[1], s[2], s[3], s[4], s[5], s[6], s[7], s[8], s[9], s[10], s[11], s[12], s[13], s[14], s[15], s[16], s[17], s[18], s[19], s[20], s[21], s[22], s[23], s[24], s[25], s[26], s[27], s[28], s[29], s[30]\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nLet’s see how well our chain performed. Ordinarily, using display(chn) would be a good first step, but we have generated a lot of parameters here (s[1], s[2], m[1], and so on). It’s a bit easier to show how our model performed graphically.\nThe code below generates an animation showing the graph of the data above, and the data our model generates in each sample.\n\n# Extract our m and s parameters from the chain.\nm_set = MCMCChains.group(chn, :m).value\ns_set = MCMCChains.group(chn, :s).value\n\n# Iterate through the MCMC samples.\nNs = 1:length(chn)\n\n# Make an animation.\nanimation = @gif for i in Ns\n    m = m_set[i, :]\n    s = Int.(s_set[i, :])\n    emissions = m[s]\n\n    p = plot(\n        y;\n        chn=:red,\n        size=(500, 250),\n        xlabel=\"Time\",\n        ylabel=\"State\",\n        legend=:topright,\n        label=\"True data\",\n        xlim=(0, 30),\n        ylim=(-1, 5),\n    )\n    plot!(emissions; color=:blue, label=\"Sample $i\")\nend every 3\n\n\n[ Info: Saved animation to /tmp/jl_glupcdmhuZ.gif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like our model did a pretty good job, but we should also check to make sure our chain converges. A quick check is to examine whether the diagonal (representing the probability of remaining in the current state) of the transition matrix appears to be stationary. The code below extracts the diagonal and shows a traceplot of each persistence probability.\n\n# Index the chain with the persistence probabilities.\nsubchain = chn[[\"T[1][1]\", \"T[2][2]\", \"T[3][3]\"]]\n\nplot(subchain; seriestype=:traceplot, title=\"Persistence Probability\", legend=false)\n\n\n\n\nA cursory examination of the traceplot above indicates that all three chains converged to something resembling stationary. We can use the diagnostic functions provided by MCMCChains to engage in some more formal tests, like the Heidelberg and Welch diagnostic:\n\nheideldiag(MCMCChains.group(chn, :T))[1]\n\n\nHeidelberger and Welch diagnostic - Chain 1\n  parameters     burnin   stationarity    pvalue      mean   halfwidth     tes ⋯\n      Symbol      Int64           Bool   Float64   Float64     Float64     Boo ⋯\n\n     T[1][1]     0.0000         1.0000    0.0528    0.8866      0.0182   1.000 ⋯\n     T[1][2]   200.0000         1.0000    0.1035    0.0538      0.0203   0.000 ⋯\n     T[1][3]   500.0000         0.0000    0.0000    0.0486      0.0294   0.000 ⋯\n     T[2][1]   400.0000         1.0000    0.0839    0.0949      0.0512   0.000 ⋯\n     T[2][2]   500.0000         0.0000    0.0001    0.7064      0.1004   0.000 ⋯\n     T[2][3]   500.0000         0.0000    0.0000    0.1987      0.1553   0.000 ⋯\n     T[3][1]   500.0000         0.0000    0.0032    0.0777      0.1131   0.000 ⋯\n     T[3][2]   500.0000         0.0000    0.0000    0.3093      0.1709   0.000 ⋯\n     T[3][3]   500.0000         0.0000    0.0000    0.6130      0.2720   0.000 ⋯\n                                                                1 column omitted\n\n\n\n\nThe p-values on the test suggest that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the observed sequence comes from a stationary distribution, so we can be reasonably confident that our transition matrix has converged to something reasonable.",

    "text": "Efficient Inference With The Forward Algorithm\nWhile the above method works well for the simple example in this tutorial, some users may desire a more efficient method, especially when their model is more complicated. One simple way to improve inference is to marginalize out the hidden states of the model with an appropriate algorithm, calculating only the posterior over the continuous random variables. Not only does this allow more efficient inference via Rao-Blackwellization, but now we can sample our model with NUTS() alone, which is usually a much more performant MCMC kernel.\nThankfully, HiddenMarkovModels.jl provides an extremely efficient implementation of many algorithms related to hidden Markov models.

    "text": "JuliaGPs packages integrate well with Turing.jl because they implement the Distributions.jl interface. You should be able to understand what is going on in this tutorial if you know what a GP is. For a more in-depth understanding of the JuliaGPs functionality used here, please consult the JuliaGPs docs.\nIn this tutorial, we will model the putting dataset discussed in Chapter 21 of Bayesian Data Analysis. The dataset comprises the result of measuring how often a golfer successfully gets the ball in the hole, depending on how far away from it they are. The goal of inference is to estimate the probability of any given shot being successful at a given distance.\n\nLet’s download the data and take a look at it:\n\nusing CSV, DataFrames\n\ndf = CSV.read(\"golf.dat\", DataFrame; delim=' ', ignorerepeated=true)\ndf[1:5, :]\n\n5×3 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\ndistance\nn\ny\n\n\n\nInt64\nInt64\nInt64\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n1443\n1346\n\n\n2\n3\n694\n577\n\n\n3\n4\n455\n337\n\n\n4\n5\n353\n208\n\n\n5\n6\n272\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve printed the first 5 rows of the dataset (which comprises only 19 rows in total). Observe it has three columns:\n\ndistance – how far away from the hole. I’ll refer to distance as d throughout the rest of this tutorial\nn – how many shots were taken from a given distance\ny – how many shots were successful from a given distance\n\nWe will use a Binomial model for the data, whose success probability is parametrised by a transformation of a GP. Something along the lines of: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf & \\sim \\operatorname{GP}(0, k) \\\\\ny_j \\mid f(d_j) & \\sim \\operatorname{Binomial}(n_j, g(f(d_j))) \\\\\ng(x) & := \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo do this, let’s define our Turing.jl model:\n\nusing AbstractGPs, LogExpFunctions, Turing\n\n@model function putting_model(d, n; jitter=1e-4)\n    v ~ Gamma(2, 1)\n    l ~ Gamma(4, 1)\n    f = GP(v * with_lengthscale(SEKernel(), l))\n    f_latent ~ f(d, jitter)\n    y ~ product_distribution(Binomial.(n, logistic.(f_latent)))\n    return (fx=f(d, jitter), f_latent=f_latent, y=y)\nend\n\nputting_model (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nWe first define an AbstractGPs.GP, which represents a distribution over functions, and is entirely separate from Turing.jl. We place a prior over its variance v and length-scale l. f(d, jitter) constructs the multivariate Gaussian comprising the random variables in f whose indices are in d (plus a bit of independent Gaussian noise with variance jitter – see the docs for more details). f(d, jitter) has the type AbstractMvNormal, and is the bit of AbstractGPs.jl that implements the Distributions.jl interface, so it’s legal to put it on the right-hand side of a ~. From this you should deduce that f_latent is distributed according to a multivariate Gaussian. The remaining lines comprise standard Turing.jl code that is encountered in other tutorials and Turing documentation.\nBefore performing inference, we might want to inspect the prior that our model places over the data, to see whether there is anything obviously wrong. These kinds of prior predictive checks are straightforward to perform using Turing.jl, since it is possible to sample from the prior easily by just calling the model:\n\nm = putting_model(Float64.(df.distance), df.n)\nm().y\n\n19-element Vector{Int64}:\n 438\n 128\n  45\n  30\n  35\n  70\n  70\n  60\n  76\n 141\n 163\n 178\n 165\n 146\n 162\n 101\n  28\n   3\n   5\n\n\nWe make use of this to see what kinds of datasets we simulate from the prior:\n\nusing Plots\n\nfunction plot_data(d, n, y, xticks, yticks)\n    ylims = (0, round(maximum(n), RoundUp; sigdigits=2))\n    margin = -0.5 * Plots.mm\n    plt = plot(; xticks=xticks, yticks=yticks, ylims=ylims, margin=margin, grid=false)\n    bar!(plt, d, n; color=:red, label=\"\", alpha=0.5)\n    bar!(plt, d, y; label=\"\", color=:blue, alpha=0.7)\n    return plt\nend\n\n# Construct model and run some prior predictive checks.\nm = putting_model(Float64.(df.distance), df.n)\nhists = map(1:20) do j\n    xticks = j &gt; 15 ? :auto : nothing\n    yticks = rem(j, 5) == 1 ? :auto : nothing\n    return plot_data(df.distance, df.n, m().y, xticks, yticks)\nend\nplot(hists...; layout=(4, 5))\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the only prior knowledge I have is that the proportion of successful shots ought to decrease monotonically as the distance from the hole increases, which should show up in the data as the blue lines generally go down as we move from left to right on each graph. Unfortunately, there is not a simple way to enforce monotonicity in the samples from a GP, and we can see this in some of the plots above, so we must hope that we have enough data to ensure that this relationship holds approximately under the posterior. In any case, you can judge for yourself whether you think this is the most useful visualisation that we can perform – if you think there is something better to look at, please let us know!\nMoving on, we generate samples from the posterior using the default NUTS sampler. We’ll make use of ReverseDiff.jl, as it has better performance than ForwardDiff.jl on this example. See the automatic differentiation docs for more info.\n\nusing Random, ReverseDiff\n\nm_post = m | (y=df.y,)\nchn = sample(Xoshiro(123456), m_post, NUTS(; adtype=AutoReverseDiff()), 1_000, progress=false)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.0125\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×35×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 155.87 seconds\nCompute duration  = 155.87 seconds\nparameters        = v, l, f_latent[1], f_latent[2], f_latent[3], f_latent[4], f_latent[5], f_latent[6], f_latent[7], f_latent[8], f_latent[9], f_latent[10], f_latent[11], f_latent[12], f_latent[13], f_latent[14], f_latent[15], f_latent[16], f_latent[17], f_latent[18], f_latent[19]\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nWe can use these samples and the posterior function from AbstractGPs to sample from the posterior probability of success at any distance we choose:\n\nd_pred = 1:0.2:21\nsamples = map(returned(m_post, chn)[1:10:end]) do x\n    return logistic.(rand(posterior(x.fx, x.f_latent)(d_pred, 1e-4)))\nend\np = plot()\nplot!(d_pred, reduce(hcat, samples); label=\"\", color=:blue, alpha=0.2)\nscatter!(df.distance, df.y ./ df.n; label=\"\", color=:red)\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the general trend is indeed down as the distance from the hole increases, and that if we move away from the data, the posterior uncertainty quickly inflates. This suggests that the model is probably going to do a reasonable job of interpolating between observed data, but less good a job at extrapolating to larger distances.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

The simulation is inspired by biological measurement of expression of genes in cells, and each cell is characterized by different gene features. While the human genome is (mostly) identical between all the cells in the body, there exist interesting differences in gene expression in different human tissues and disease conditions. One way to investigate certain diseases is to look at differences in gene expression in cells from patients and healthy controls (usually from the same tissue).\nUsually, we can assume that the changes in gene expression only affect a subset of all genes (and these can be linked to diseases in some way). One of the challenges for this kind of data is to explore the underlying structure, e.g. to make the connection between a certain state (healthy/disease) and gene expression. This becomes difficult when the dimensions is very large (up to 20000 genes across 1000s of cells). So in order to find structure in this data, it is useful to project the data into a lower dimensional space.\nRegardless of the biological background, the more abstract problem formulation is to project the data living in high-dimensional space onto a representation in lower-dimensional space where most of the variation is concentrated in the first few dimensions. We use PCA to explore underlying structure or pattern which may not necessarily be obvious from looking at the raw data itself.\n\nStep 1: configuration of dependencies\nFirst, we load the dependencies used.\n\nusing Turing\nusing Mooncake\nusing LinearAlgebra, FillArrays\n\n# Packages for visualization\nusing DataFrames, StatsPlots, Measures\n\n# Set a seed for reproducibility.\nusing Random\nRandom.seed!(1789);\n\nAll packages used in this tutorial are listed here. You can install them via using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"package_name\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionPackage usages:\n\n\n\nWe use DataFrames for instantiating matrices, LinearAlgebra and FillArrays to perform matrix operations; Turing for model specification and MCMC sampling, Mooncake for automatic differentiation when sampling. StatsPlots for visualising the resutls. , Measures for setting plot margin units. As all examples involve sampling, for reproducibility we set a fixed seed using the Random standard library.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Data generation\nHere, we simulate the biological gene expression problem described earlier. We simulate 60 cells, each cell has 9 gene features. This is a simplified problem with only a few cells and genes for demonstration purpose, which is not comparable to the complexity in real-life (e.g. thousands of features for each individual). Even so, spotting the structures or patterns in a 9-feature space would be a challenging task; it would be nice to reduce the dimentionality using p-PCA.\nBy design, we mannually divide the 60 cells into two groups. the first 3 gene features of the first 30 cells have mean 10, while those of the last 30 cells have mean 10. These two groups of cells differ in the expression of genes.\n\nn_genes = 9 # D\nn_cells = 60 # N\n\n# create a diagonal block like expression matrix, with some non-informative genes;\n# not all features/genes are informative, some might just not differ very much between cells)\nmat_exp = randn(n_genes, n_cells)\nmat_exp[1:(n_genes ÷ 3), 1:(n_cells ÷ 2)] .+= 10\nmat_exp[(2 * (n_genes ÷ 3) + 1):end, (n_cells ÷ 2 + 1):end] .+= 10\n\n3×30 view(::Matrix{Float64}, 7:9, 31:60) with eltype Float64:\n 11.7413   10.5735   11.3817    8.50923  …   7.38716   8.7734   11.4717\n  9.28533  11.1225    9.43421  10.8904      11.6846   10.7264    9.64063\n  9.92113   8.42122   9.59885   9.90799      9.40715   8.40956  10.2522\n\n\nTo visualize the \\((D=9) \\times (N=60)\\) data matrix mat_exp, we use the heatmap plot.\n\nheatmap(\n    mat_exp;\n    c=:summer,\n    colors=:value,\n    xlabel=\"cell number\",\n    yflip=true,\n    ylabel=\"gene feature\",\n    yticks=1:9,\n    colorbar_title=\"expression\",\n)\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nWe have made distinct feature differences between these two groups of cells (it is fairly obvious from looking at the raw data), in practice and with large enough data sets, it is often impossible to spot the differences from the raw data alone.\nIf you have some patience and compute resources you can increase the size of the dataset, or play around with the noise levels to make the problem increasingly harder.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create the pPCA model\nHere we construct the probabilistic model pPCA(). As per the p-PCA formula, we think of each row (i.e. each gene feature) following a \\(N=60\\) dimensional multivariate normal distribution centered around the corresponding row of \\(\\mathbf{W}_{D \\times k} \\times \\mathbf{Z}_{k \\times N} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{D \\times N}\\).\n\n@model function pPCA(X::AbstractMatrix{&lt;:Real}, k::Int)\n    # retrieve the dimension of input matrix X.\n    N, D = size(X)\n\n    # weights/loadings W\n    W ~ filldist(Normal(), D, k)\n\n    # latent variable z\n    Z ~ filldist(Normal(), k, N)\n\n    # mean offset\n    μ ~ MvNormal(Eye(D))\n    genes_mean = W * Z .+ reshape(μ, n_genes, 1)\n    return X ~ arraydist([MvNormal(m, Eye(N)) for m in eachcol(genes_mean')])\nend;\n\nThe function pPCA() accepts:\n\nan data array \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (with no. of instances x dimension no. of features, NB: it is a transpose of the original data matrix);\nan integer \\(k\\) which indicates the dimension of the latent space (the space the original feature matrix is projected onto).\n\nSpecifically:\n\nit first extracts the dimension \\(D\\) and number of instances \\(N\\) of the input matrix;\ndraw samples of each entries of the projection matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) from a standard normal;\ndraw samples of the latent variable \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{k \\times N}\\) from an MND;\ndraw samples of the offset \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) from an MND, assuming uniform offset for all instances;\nFinally, we iterate through each gene dimension in \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), and define an MND for the sampling distribution (i.e. likelihood).\n\n\n\nStep 4: Sampling-based inference of the pPCA model\nHere we aim to perform MCMC sampling to infer the projection matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}_{D \\times k}\\), the latent variable matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{k \\times N}\\), and the offsets \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{N \\times 1}\\).\nWe run the inference using the NUTS sampler. By default, sample samples a single chain (in this case with 500 samples). You can also use different samplers if you wish.\n\nsetprogress!(false)\n\n\nk = 2 # k is the dimension of the projected space, i.e. the number of principal components/axes of choice\nppca = pPCA(mat_exp', k) # instantiate the probabilistic model\nchain_ppca = sample(ppca, NUTS(; adtype=AutoMooncake()), 500);\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.4\n\n\n\n\nThe samples are saved in chain_ppca, which is an MCMCChains.Chains object.

This is satisfying as we have just projected the original 9-dimensional space onto a 2-dimensional space - some info has been cut off in the projection process, but we haven’t lost any important info, e.g. the key differences between the two groups. The is the desirable property of PCA: it picks up the principal axes along which most of the (original) data variations cluster, and remove those less relevant. If we choose the reduced space dimension \\(k\\) to be exactly \\(D\\) (the original data dimension), we would recover exactly the same original data matrix mat_exp, i.e. all information will be preserved.\nNow we have represented the original high-dimensional data in two dimensions, without lossing the key information about the two groups of cells in the input data. Finally, the benefits of performing PCA is to analyse and visualise the dimension-reduced data in the projected, low-dimensional space. we save the dimension-reduced matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) as a DataFrame, rename the columns and visualise the first two dimensions.\n\ndf_pca = DataFrame(Z', :auto)\nrename!(df_pca, Symbol.([\"z\" * string(i) for i in collect(1:k)]))\ndf_pca[!, :type] = repeat([1, 2]; inner=n_cells ÷ 2)\n\nscatter(df_pca[:, :z1], df_pca[:, :z2]; xlabel=\"z1\", ylabel=\"z2\", group=df_pca[:, :type])\n\n\n\n\nWe see the two groups are well separated in this 2-D space. As an unsupervised learning method, performing PCA on this dataset gives membership for each cell instance. Another way to put it: 2 dimensions is enough to capture the main structure of the data.\n\n\nFurther extension: automatic choice of the number of principal components with ARD\nA direct question arises from above practice is: how many principal components do we want to keep, in order to sufficiently represent the latent structure in the data? This is a very central question for all latent factor models, i.e. how many dimensions are needed to represent that data in the latent space. In the case of PCA, there exist a lot of heuristics to make that choice. For example, We can tune the number of principal components using empirical methods such as cross-validation based on some criteria such as MSE between the posterior predicted (e.g. mean predictions) data matrix and the original data matrix or the percentage of variation explained 5.\nFor p-PCA, this can be done in an elegant and principled way, using a technique called Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). ARD can help pick the correct number of principal directions by regularizing the solution space using a parameterized, data-dependent prior distribution that effectively prunes away redundant or superfluous features 6. Essentially, we are using a specific prior over the factor loadings \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) that allows us to prune away dimensions in the latent space. The prior is determined by a precision hyperparameter \\(\\alpha\\). Here, smaller values of \\(\\alpha\\) correspond to more important components. You can find more details about this in, for example, Bishop (2006) 7.\n\n@model function pPCA_ARD(X)\n    # Dimensionality of the problem.\n    N, D = size(X)\n\n    # latent variable Z\n    Z ~ filldist(Normal(), D, N)\n\n    # weights/loadings w with Automatic Relevance Determination part\n    α ~ filldist(Gamma(1.0, 1.0), D)\n    W ~ filldist(MvNormal(zeros(D), 1.0 ./ sqrt.(α)), D)\n\n    mu = (W' * Z)'\n\n    tau ~ Gamma(1.0, 1.0)\n    return X ~ arraydist([MvNormal(m, 1.0 / sqrt(tau)) for m in eachcol(mu)])\nend;\n\nInstead of drawing samples of each entry in \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) from a standard normal, this time we repeatedly draw \\(D\\) samples from the \\(D\\)-dimensional MND, forming a \\(D \\times D\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{W}\\). This matrix is a function of \\(\\alpha\\) as the samples are drawn from the MND parameterized by \\(\\alpha\\). We also introduce a hyper-parameter \\(\\tau\\) which is the precision in the sampling distribution. We also re-paramterise the sampling distribution, i.e. each dimension across all instances is a 60-dimensional multivariate normal distribution. Re-parameterisation can sometimes accelrate the sampling process.\nWe instantiate the model and ask Turing to sample from it using NUTS sampler. The sample trajectories of \\(\\alpha\\) is plotted using the plot function from the package StatsPlots.\n\nppca_ARD = pPCA_ARD(mat_exp') # instantiate the probabilistic model\nchain_ppcaARD = sample(ppca_ARD, NUTS(; adtype=AutoMooncake()), 500) # sampling\nplot(group(chain_ppcaARD, :α); margin=6.0mm)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.00625\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we do some inference diagnostics. Here we look at the convergence of the chains for the \\(α\\) parameter. This parameter determines the relevance of individual components. We see that the chains have converged and the posterior of the \\(\\alpha\\) parameters is centered around much smaller values in two instances. In the following, we will use the mean of the small values to select the relevant dimensions (remember that, smaller values of \\(\\alpha\\) correspond to more important components.). We can clearly see from the values of \\(\\alpha\\) that there should be two dimensions (corresponding to \\(\\bar{\\alpha}_3=\\bar{\\alpha}_5≈0.05\\)) for this dataset.\n\n# Extract parameter mean estimates of the posterior\nW = permutedims(reshape(mean(group(chain_ppcaARD, :W))[:, 2], (n_genes, n_genes)))\nZ = permutedims(reshape(mean(group(chain_ppcaARD, :Z))[:, 2], (n_genes, n_cells)))'\nα = mean(group(chain_ppcaARD, :α))[:, 2]\nplot(α; label=\"α\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can inspect α to see which elements are small (i.e. high relevance). To do this, we first sort α using sortperm() (in ascending order by default), and record the indices of the first two smallest values (among the \\(D=9\\) \\(\\alpha\\) values). After picking the desired principal directions, we extract the corresponding subset loading vectors from \\(\\mathbf{W}\\), and the corresponding dimensions of \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\). We obtain a posterior predicted matrix \\(\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 60}\\) as the product of the two sub-matrices, and compare the recovered info with the original matrix.\n\nα_indices = sortperm(α)[1:2]\nk = size(α_indices)[1]\nX_rec = W[:, α_indices] * Z[α_indices, :]\n\ndf_rec = DataFrame(X_rec', :auto)\nheatmap(\n    X_rec;\n    c=:summer,\n    colors=:value,\n    xlabel=\"cell number\",\n    yflip=true,\n    ylabel=\"gene feature\",\n    yticks=1:9,\n    colorbar_title=\"expression\",\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that, the data in the original space is recovered with key information, the distinct feature values in the first and last three genes for the two cell groups, are preserved. We can also examine the data in the dimension-reduced space, i.e. the selected components (rows) in \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\).\n\ndf_pro = DataFrame(Z[α_indices, :]', :auto)\nrename!(df_pro, Symbol.([\"z\" * string(i) for i in collect(1:k)]))\ndf_pro[!, :type] = repeat([1, 2]; inner=n_cells ÷ 2)\nscatter(\n    df_pro[:, 1], df_pro[:, 2]; xlabel=\"z1\", ylabel=\"z2\", color=df_pro[:, \"type\"], label=\"\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is very similar to the low-dimensional plot above, with the relevant dimensions chosen based on the values of \\(α\\) via ARD. When you are in doubt about the number of dimensions to project onto, ARD might provide an answer to that question.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous tutorial, we have discussed latent variable models, in particular probabilistic principal component analysis (pPCA). Here, we show how we can extend the mapping provided by pPCA to non-linear mappings between input and output. For more details about the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM), we refer the reader to the original publication and a further extension.\nIn short, the GPVLM is a dimensionality reduction technique that allows us to embed a high-dimensional dataset in a lower-dimensional embedding. Importantly, it provides the advantage that the linear mappings from the embedded space can be non-linearised through the use of Gaussian Processes.\n\nLet’s start by loading some dependencies.\n\nusing Turing\nusing AbstractGPs\nusing FillArrays\nusing LaTeXStrings\nusing Plots\nusing RDatasets\nusing ReverseDiff\nusing StatsBase\n\nusing LinearAlgebra\nusing Random\n\nRandom.seed!(1789);\n\nWe demonstrate the GPLVM with a very small dataset: Fisher’s Iris data set. This is mostly for reasons of run time, so the tutorial can be run quickly. As you will see, one of the major drawbacks of using GPs is their speed, although this is an active area of research. We will briefly touch on some ways to speed things up at the end of this tutorial. We transform the original data with non-linear operations in order to demonstrate the power of GPs to work on non-linear relationships, while keeping the problem reasonably small.\n\ndata = dataset(\"datasets\", \"iris\")\nspecies = data[!, \"Species\"]\nindex = shuffle(1:150)\n# we extract the four measured quantities,\n# so the dimension of the data is only d=4 for this toy example\ndat = Matrix(data[index, 1:4])\nlabels = data[index, \"Species\"]\n\n# non-linearize data to demonstrate ability of GPs to deal with non-linearity\ndat[:, 1] = 0.5 * dat[:, 1] .^ 2 + 0.1 * dat[:, 1] .^ 3\ndat[:, 2] = dat[:, 2] .^ 3 + 0.2 * dat[:, 2] .^ 4\ndat[:, 3] = 0.1 * exp.(dat[:, 3]) - 0.2 * dat[:, 3] .^ 2\ndat[:, 4] = 0.5 * log.(dat[:, 4]) .^ 2 + 0.01 * dat[:, 3] .^ 5\n\n# normalize data\ndt = fit(ZScoreTransform, dat; dims=1);\nStatsBase.transform!(dt, dat);\n\nWe will start out by demonstrating the basic similarity between pPCA (see the tutorial on this topic) and the GPLVM model. Indeed, pPCA is basically equivalent to running the GPLVM model with an automatic relevance determination (ARD) linear kernel.\nFirst, we re-introduce the pPCA model (see the tutorial on pPCA for details)\n\n@model function pPCA(x)\n    # Dimensionality of the problem.\n    N, D = size(x)\n    # latent variable z\n    z ~ filldist(Normal(), D, N)\n    # weights/loadings W\n    w ~ filldist(Normal(), D, D)\n    mu = (w * z)'\n    for d in 1:D\n        x[:, d] ~ MvNormal(mu[:, d], I)\n    end\n    return nothing\nend;\n\nWe define two different kernels, a simple linear kernel with an Automatic Relevance Determination transform and a squared exponential kernel.\n\nlinear_kernel(α) = LinearKernel() ∘ ARDTransform(α)\nsekernel(α, σ) = σ * SqExponentialKernel() ∘ ARDTransform(α);\n\nAnd here is the GPLVM model. We create separate models for the two types of kernel.\n\n@model function GPLVM_linear(Y, K)\n    # Dimensionality of the problem.\n    N, D = size(Y)\n    # K is the dimension of the latent space\n    @assert K &lt;= D\n    noise = 1e-3\n\n    # Priors\n    α ~ MvLogNormal(MvNormal(Zeros(K), I))\n    Z ~ filldist(Normal(), K, N)\n    mu ~ filldist(Normal(), N)\n\n    gp = GP(linear_kernel(α))\n    gpz = gp(ColVecs(Z), noise)\n    Y ~ filldist(MvNormal(mu, cov(gpz)), D)\n\n    return nothing\nend;\n\n@model function GPLVM(Y, K)\n    # Dimensionality of the problem.\n    N, D = size(Y)\n    # K is the dimension of the latent space\n    @assert K &lt;= D\n    noise = 1e-3\n\n    # Priors\n    α ~ MvLogNormal(MvNormal(Zeros(K), I))\n    σ ~ LogNormal(0.0, 1.0)\n    Z ~ filldist(Normal(), K, N)\n    mu ~ filldist(Normal(), N)\n\n    gp = GP(sekernel(α, σ))\n    gpz = gp(ColVecs(Z), noise)\n    Y ~ filldist(MvNormal(mu, cov(gpz)), D)\n\n    return nothing\nend;\n\n\n# Standard GPs don't scale very well in n, so we use a small subsample for the purpose of this tutorial\nn_data = 40\n# number of features to use from dataset\nn_features = 4\n# latent dimension for GP case\nndim = 4;\n\n\nppca = pPCA(dat[1:n_data, 1:n_features])\nchain_ppca = sample(ppca, NUTS{Turing.ReverseDiffAD{true}}(), 1000);\n\n\n# we extract the posterior mean estimates of the parameters from the chain\nz_mean = reshape(mean(group(chain_ppca, :z))[:, 2], (n_features, n_data))\nscatter(z_mean[1, :], z_mean[2, :]; group=labels[1:n_data], xlabel=L\"z_1\", ylabel=L\"z_2\")\n\nWe can see that the pPCA fails to distinguish the groups. In particular, the setosa species is not clearly separated from versicolor and virginica. This is due to the non-linearities that we introduced, as without them the two groups can be clearly distinguished using pPCA (see the pPCA tutorial).\nLet’s try the same with our linear kernel GPLVM model.\n\ngplvm_linear = GPLVM_linear(dat[1:n_data, 1:n_features], ndim)\nchain_linear = sample(gplvm_linear, NUTS{Turing.ReverseDiffAD{true}}(), 500);\n\n\n# we extract the posterior mean estimates of the parameters from the chain\nz_mean = reshape(mean(group(chain_linear, :Z))[:, 2], (n_features, n_data))\nalpha_mean = mean(group(chain_linear, :α))[:, 2]\n\nalpha1, alpha2 = partialsortperm(alpha_mean, 1:2; rev=true)\nscatter(\n    z_mean[alpha1, :],\n    z_mean[alpha2, :];\n    group=labels[1:n_data],\n    xlabel=L\"z_{\\mathrm{ard}_1}\",\n    ylabel=L\"z_{\\mathrm{ard}_2}\",\n)\n\nWe can see that similar to the pPCA case, the linear kernel GPLVM fails to distinguish between the two groups (setosa on the one hand, and virginica and verticolor on the other).\nFinally, we demonstrate that by changing the kernel to a non-linear function, we are able to separate the data again.\n\ngplvm = GPLVM(dat[1:n_data, 1:n_features], ndim)\nchain_gplvm = sample(gplvm, NUTS{Turing.ReverseDiffAD{true}}(), 500);\n\n\n# we extract the posterior mean estimates of the parameters from the chain\nz_mean = reshape(mean(group(chain_gplvm, :Z))[:, 2], (ndim, n_data))\nalpha_mean = mean(group(chain_gplvm, :α))[:, 2]\n\nalpha1, alpha2 = partialsortperm(alpha_mean, 1:2; rev=true)\nscatter(\n    z_mean[alpha1, :],\n    z_mean[alpha2, :];\n    group=labels[1:n_data],\n    xlabel=L\"z_{\\mathrm{ard}_1}\",\n    ylabel=L\"z_{\\mathrm{ard}_2}\",\n)\n\n\nlet\n    @assert abs(\n        mean(z_mean[alpha1, labels[1:n_data] .== \"setosa\"]) -\n        mean(z_mean[alpha1, labels[1:n_data] .!= \"setosa\"]),\n    ) &gt; 1\nend\n\nNow, the split between the two groups is visible again.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

This is consistent with Andrew Gelman’s recommendations on noninformative priors for variance. The intercept term (\\(\\alpha\\)) is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of three. This represents our assumptions that miles per gallon can be explained mostly by our assorted variables, but a high variance term indicates our uncertainty about that. Each coefficient is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of 10. We do not know that our coefficients are different from zero, and we don’t know which ones are likely to be the most important, so the variance term is quite high.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is the first of a series of guided tutorials on the Turing language. In this tutorial, we will use Bayesian inference to estimate the probability that a coin flip will result in heads, given a series of observations.\n\nSetup\nFirst, let us load some packages that we need to simulate a coin flip:\n\nusing Distributions\n\nusing Random\nRandom.seed!(12); # Set seed for reproducibility\n\nand to visualize our results.\n\nusing StatsPlots\n\nNote that Turing is not loaded here — we do not use it in this example. Next, we configure the data generating model. Let us set the true probability that a coin flip turns up heads\n\np_true = 0.5;\n\nand set the number of coin flips we will show our model.\n\nN = 100;\n\nWe simulate N coin flips by drawing N random samples from the Bernoulli distribution with success probability p_true. The draws are collected in a variable called data:\n\ndata = rand(Bernoulli(p_true), N);\n\nHere are the first five coin flips:\n\ndata[1:5]\n\n5-element Vector{Bool}:\n 1\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 1\n\n\n\n\nCoin Flipping Without Turing\nThe following example illustrates the effect of updating our beliefs with every piece of new evidence we observe.\nAssume that we are unsure about the probability of heads in a coin flip. To get an intuitive understanding of what “updating our beliefs” is, we will visualize the probability of heads in a coin flip after each observed evidence.\nWe begin by specifying a prior belief about the distribution of heads and tails in a coin toss. Here we choose a Beta distribution as prior distribution for the probability of heads. Before any coin flip is observed, we assume a uniform distribution \\(\\operatorname{U}(0, 1) = \\operatorname{Beta}(1, 1)\\) of the probability of heads. I.e., every probability is equally likely initially.\n\nprior_belief = Beta(1, 1);\n\nWith our priors set and our data at hand, we can perform Bayesian inference.\nThis is a fairly simple process. We expose one additional coin flip to our model every iteration, such that the first run only sees the first coin flip, while the last iteration sees all the coin flips. In each iteration we update our belief to an updated version of the original Beta distribution that accounts for the new proportion of heads and tails. The update is particularly simple since our prior distribution is a conjugate prior. Note that a closed-form expression for the posterior (implemented in the updated_belief expression below) is not accessible in general and usually does not exist for more interesting models.\n\nfunction updated_belief(prior_belief::Beta, data::AbstractArray{Bool})\n    # Count the number of heads and tails.\n    heads = sum(data)\n    tails = length(data) - heads\n\n    # Update our prior belief in closed form (this is possible because we use a conjugate prior).\n    return Beta(prior_belief.α + heads, prior_belief.β + tails)\nend\n\n# Show updated belief for increasing number of observations\n@gif for n in 0:N\n    plot(\n        updated_belief(prior_belief, data[1:n]);\n        size=(500, 250),\n        title=\"Updated belief after $n observations\",\n        xlabel=\"probability of heads\",\n        ylabel=\"\",\n        legend=nothing,\n        xlim=(0, 1),\n        fill=0,\n        α=0.3,\n        w=3,\n    )\n    vline!([p_true])\nend\n\n\nGKS: cannot open display - headless operation mode active\n[ Info: Saved animation to /tmp/jl_ePy5MbKBI5.gif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe animation above shows that with increasing evidence our belief about the probability of heads in a coin flip slowly adjusts towards the true value. The orange line in the animation represents the true probability of seeing heads on a single coin flip, while the mode of the distribution shows what the model believes the probability of a heads is given the evidence it has seen.\nFor the mathematically inclined, the \\(\\operatorname{Beta}\\) distribution is updated by adding each coin flip to the parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) of the distribution. Initially, the parameters are defined as \\(\\alpha = 1\\) and \\(\\beta = 1\\). Over time, with more and more coin flips, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) will be approximately equal to each other as we are equally likely to flip a heads or a tails.\nThe mean of the \\(\\operatorname{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) distribution is\n\\[\\operatorname{E}[X] = \\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}.\\]\nThis implies that the plot of the distribution will become centered around 0.5 for a large enough number of coin flips, as we expect \\(\\alpha \\approx \\beta\\).\nThe variance of the \\(\\operatorname{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) distribution is\n\\[\\operatorname{var}[X] = \\dfrac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha + \\beta)^2 (\\alpha + \\beta + 1)}.\\]\nThus the variance of the distribution will approach 0 with more and more samples, as the denominator will grow faster than will the numerator. More samples means less variance. This implies that the distribution will reflect less uncertainty about the probability of receiving a heads and the plot will become more tightly centered around 0.5 for a large enough number of coin flips.\n\n\nCoin Flipping With Turing\nWe now move away from the closed-form expression above. We use Turing to specify the same model and to approximate the posterior distribution with samples. To do so, we first need to load Turing.\n\nusing Turing\n\nAdditionally, we load MCMCChains, a library for analyzing and visualizing the samples with which we approximate the posterior distribution.\n\nusing MCMCChains\n\nFirst, we define the coin-flip model using Turing.\n\n# Unconditioned coinflip model with `N` observations.\n@model function coinflip(; N::Int)\n    # Our prior belief about the probability of heads in a coin toss.\n    p ~ Beta(1, 1)\n\n    # Heads or tails of a coin are drawn from `N` independent and identically\n    # distributed Bernoulli distributions with success rate `p`.\n    y ~ filldist(Bernoulli(p), N)\n\n    return y\nend;\n\nIn the Turing model the prior distribution of the variable p, the probability of heads in a coin toss, and the distribution of the observations y are specified on the right-hand side of the ~ expressions. The @model macro modifies the body of the Julia function coinflip and, e.g., replaces the ~ statements with internal function calls that are used for sampling.\nHere we defined a model that is not conditioned on any specific observations as this allows us to easily obtain samples of both p and y with\n\nrand(coinflip(; N))\n\n(p = 0.9520583115441003, y = Bool[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1  …  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n\n\nThe model can be conditioned on some observations with |. See the documentation of the condition syntax in DynamicPPL.jl for more details. In the conditioned model the observations y are fixed to data.\n\ncoinflip(y::AbstractVector{&lt;:Real}) = coinflip(; N=length(y)) | (; y)\n\nmodel = coinflip(data);\n\nAfter defining the model, we can approximate the posterior distribution by drawing samples from the distribution. In this example, we use a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to draw these samples. Other tutorials give more information on the samplers available in Turing and discuss their use for different models.\n\nsampler = NUTS();\n\nWe approximate the posterior distribution with 1000 samples:\n\nchain = sample(model, sampler, 2_000, progress=false);\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.8\n\n\n\n\nThe sample function and common keyword arguments are explained more extensively in the documentation of AbstractMCMC.jl.\nAfter finishing the sampling process, we can visually compare the closed-form posterior distribution with the approximation obtained with Turing.\n\nhistogram(chain)\n\n\n\n\nNow we can build our plot:\n\n# Visualize a blue density plot of the approximate posterior distribution using HMC (see Chain 1 in the legend).\ndensity(chain; xlim=(0, 1), legend=:best, w=2, c=:blue)\n\n# Visualize a green density plot of the posterior distribution in closed-form.\nplot!(\n    0:0.01:1,\n    pdf.(updated_belief(prior_belief, data), 0:0.01:1);\n    xlabel=\"probability of heads\",\n    ylabel=\"\",\n    title=\"\",\n    xlim=(0, 1),\n    label=\"Closed-form\",\n    fill=0,\n    α=0.3,\n    w=3,\n    c=:lightgreen,\n)\n\n# Visualize the true probability of heads in red.\nvline!([p_true]; label=\"True probability\", c=:red)\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the samples obtained with Turing closely approximate the true posterior distribution. Hopefully this tutorial has provided an easy-to-follow, yet informative introduction to Turing’s simpler applications. More advanced usage is demonstrated in other tutorials.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "The Lotka–Volterra Model\nThe Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the predator–prey equations, are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations. These differential equations are frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= (\\alpha - \\beta y(t))x(t), \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= (\\delta x(t) - \\gamma)y(t),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) denote the populations of prey and predator at time \\(t\\), respectively, and \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta\\) are positive parameters. In the absence of predators, the prey population \\(x\\) would increase exponentially at rate \\(\\alpha\\) (with dimensions of time-1). However, the predators kill some prey at a rate \\(\\beta\\) (prey predator-1 time-1), which enables the predator population to increase at rate \\(\\delta\\) (predators prey-1 time-1). Finally, predators are removed by natural mortality at rate \\(\\gamma\\) (time-1).\nWe implement the Lotka–Volterra model and simulate it with parameters \\(\\alpha = 1.5\\), \\(\\beta = 1\\), \\(\\gamma = 3\\), and \\(\\delta = 1\\) and initial conditions \\(x(0) = y(0) = 1\\).\n\n# Define Lotka–Volterra model.\nfunction lotka_volterra(du, u, p, t)\n    # Model parameters.\n    α, β, γ, δ = p\n    # Current state.\n    x, y = u\n\n    # Evaluate differential equations.\n    du[1] = (α - β * y) * x # prey\n    du[2] = (δ * x - γ) * y # predator\n\n    return nothing\nend\n\n# Define initial-value problem.\nu0 = [1.0, 1.0]\np = [1.5, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0]\ntspan = (0.0, 10.0)\nprob = ODEProblem(lotka_volterra, u0, tspan, p)\n\n# Plot simulation.\nplot(solve(prob, Tsit5()))\n\n\n\n\nWe generate noisy observations to use for the parameter estimation tasks in this tutorial. With the saveat argument to the differential equation solver, we specify that the solution is stored only at 0.1 time units.\nTo make the example more realistic, we generate data as random Poisson counts based on the “true” population densities of predator and prey from the simulation. Poisson-distributed data are common in ecology (for instance, counts of animals detected by a camera trap). We’ll assume that the rate \\(\\lambda\\), which parameterizes the Poisson distribution, is proportional to the underlying animal densities via a constant factor \\(q = 1.7\\).\n\nsol = solve(prob, Tsit5(); saveat=0.1)\nq = 1.7\nodedata = rand.(Poisson.(q * Array(sol)))\n\n# Plot simulation and noisy observations.\nplot(sol, label=[\"Prey\" \"Predator\"])\nscatter!(sol.t, odedata'; color=[1 2], label=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nAn even more realistic example could be fitted to the famous hare-and-lynx system using the long-term trapping records of the Hudson’s Bay Company.

    "text": "Direct Handling of Bayesian Estimation with Turing\nDifferentialEquations.jl is the main Julia package for numerically solving differential equations. Its functionality is completely interoperable with Turing.jl, which means that we can directly simulate differential equations inside a Turing @model.\nFor the purposes of this tutorial, we choose priors for the parameters that are quite close to the ground truth. As justification, we can imagine we have preexisting estimates for the biological rates. Practically, this helps us to illustrate the results without needing to run overly long MCMC chains.\nNote we also have to take special care with the ODE solver. For certain parameter combinations, the numerical solver may predict animal densities that are just barely below zero. This causes errors with the Poisson distribution, which needs a non-negative mean \\(\\lambda\\). To avoid this happening, we tell the solver to aim for small absolute and relative errors (abstol=1e-6, reltol=1e-6). We also add a fudge factor ϵ = 1e-5 to the predicted data. Since ϵ is greater than the solver’s tolerance, it should overcome any remaining numerical error, making sure all predicted values are positive. At the same time, it is so small compared to the data that it should have a negligible effect on inference. If this approach doesn’t work, there are some more ideas to try here. In the case of continuous observations (e.g. data derived from modelling chemical reactions), it is sufficient to use a normal distribution with the mean as the data point and an appropriately chosen variance (which can itself also be a parameter with a prior distribution).\n\n@model function fitlv(data, prob)\n    # Prior distributions.\n    α ~ truncated(Normal(1.5, 0.2); lower=0.5, upper=2.5)\n    β ~ truncated(Normal(1.1, 0.2); lower=0, upper=2)\n    γ ~ truncated(Normal(3.0, 0.2); lower=1, upper=4)\n    δ ~ truncated(Normal(1.0, 0.2); lower=0, upper=2)\n    q ~ truncated(Normal(1.7, 0.2); lower=0, upper=3)\n\n    # Simulate Lotka–Volterra model. \n    p = [α, β, γ, δ]\n    predicted = solve(prob, Tsit5(); p=p, saveat=0.1, abstol=1e-6, reltol=1e-6)\n    ϵ = 1e-5\n    \n    # Observations.\n    for i in eachindex(predicted)\n        data[:, i] ~ arraydist(Poisson.(q .* predicted[i] .+ ϵ))\n    end\n\n    return nothing\nend\n\nmodel = fitlv(odedata, prob)\n\n# Sample 3 independent chains with forward-mode automatic differentiation (the default).\nchain = sample(model, NUTS(), MCMCSerial(), 1000, 3; progress=false)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.2\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.2\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.05\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×19×3 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 3\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 49.48 seconds\nCompute duration  = 45.31 seconds\nparameters        = α, β, γ, δ, q\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nThe estimated parameters are close to the parameter values the observations were generated with.

Here, we solve the ODE for 300 randomly picked posterior samples in the chain. We plot the ensemble of solutions to check if the solution resembles the data. The 300 retrodicted time courses from the posterior are plotted in gray, the noisy observations are shown as blue and red dots, and the green and purple lines are the ODE solution that was used to generate the data.\n\nplot(; legend=false)\nposterior_samples = sample(chain[[:α, :β, :γ, :δ]], 300; replace=false)\nfor p in eachrow(Array(posterior_samples))\n    sol_p = solve(prob, Tsit5(); p=p, saveat=0.1)\n    plot!(sol_p; alpha=0.1, color=\"#BBBBBB\")\nend\n\n# Plot simulation and noisy observations.\nplot!(sol; color=[1 2], linewidth=1)\nscatter!(sol.t, odedata'; color=[1 2])\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that, even though we added quite a bit of noise to the data the posterior distribution reproduces quite accurately the “true” ODE solution.",

    "text": "Inference of Delay Differential Equations\nHere we show an example of inference with another type of differential equation: a delay differential equation (DDE). DDEs are differential equations where derivatives are functions of values at an earlier point in time. This is useful to model a delayed effect, such as the incubation time of a virus.\nHere is a delayed version of the Lotka–Volterra system:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\alpha x(t-\\tau) - \\beta y(t) x(t),\\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= - \\gamma y(t) + \\delta x(t) y(t),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) is a (positive) delay and \\(x(t-\\tau)\\) is the variable \\(x\\) at an earlier time point \\(t - \\tau\\).\nThe initial-value problem of the delayed system can be implemented as a DDEProblem. As described in the DDE example, here the function h is the history function that can be used to obtain a state at an earlier time point. Again we use parameters \\(\\alpha = 1.5\\), \\(\\beta = 1\\), \\(\\gamma = 3\\), and \\(\\delta = 1\\) and initial conditions \\(x(0) = y(0) = 1\\). Moreover, we assume \\(x(t) = 1\\) for \\(t &lt; 0\\).\n\nfunction delay_lotka_volterra(du, u, h, p, t)\n    # Model parameters.\n    α, β, γ, δ = p\n\n    # Current state.\n    x, y = u\n    # Evaluate differential equations\n    du[1] = α * h(p, t - 1; idxs=1) - β * x * y\n    du[2] = -γ * y + δ * x * y\n\n    return nothing\nend\n\n# Define initial-value problem.\np = (1.5, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0)\nu0 = [1.0; 1.0]\ntspan = (0.0, 10.0)\nh(p, t; idxs::Int) = 1.0\nprob_dde = DDEProblem(delay_lotka_volterra, u0, h, tspan, p);\n\nWe generate observations by sampling from the corresponding Poisson distributions derived from the simulation results:\n\nsol_dde = solve(prob_dde; saveat=0.1)\nddedata = rand.(Poisson.(q .* Array(sol_dde)))\n\n# Plot simulation and noisy observations.\nplot(sol_dde)\nscatter!(sol_dde.t, ddedata'; color=[1 2], label=\"\")\n\n\n\n\nNow we define the Turing model for the Lotka–Volterra model with a delay, and sample 3 independent chains.\n\n@model function fitlv_dde(data, prob)\n    # Prior distributions.\n    α ~ truncated(Normal(1.5, 0.2); lower=0.5, upper=2.5)\n    β ~ truncated(Normal(1.1, 0.2); lower=0, upper=2)\n    γ ~ truncated(Normal(3.0, 0.2); lower=1, upper=4)\n    δ ~ truncated(Normal(1.0, 0.2); lower=0, upper=2)\n    q ~ truncated(Normal(1.7, 0.2); lower=0, upper=3)\n\n    # Simulate Lotka–Volterra model.\n    p = [α, β, γ, δ]\n    predicted = solve(prob, MethodOfSteps(Tsit5()); p=p, saveat=0.1, abstol=1e-6, reltol=1e-6)\n    ϵ = 1e-5\n\n    # Observations.\n    for i in eachindex(predicted)\n        data[:, i] ~ arraydist(Poisson.(q .* predicted[i] .+ ϵ))\n    end\nend\n\nmodel_dde = fitlv_dde(ddedata, prob_dde)\n\nchain_dde = sample(model_dde, NUTS(), MCMCSerial(), 300, 3; progress=false)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.05\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.05\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.2\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (300×19×3 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 151:1:450\nNumber of chains  = 3\nSamples per chain = 300\nWall duration     = 13.73 seconds\nCompute duration  = 13.48 seconds\nparameters        = α, β, γ, δ, q\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\nplot(chain_dde)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we plot trajectories of 300 randomly selected samples from the posterior.

    "text": "Scaling to Large Models: Adjoint Sensitivities\nDifferentialEquations.jl’s efficiency for large stiff models has been shown in multiple benchmarks. To learn more about how to optimize solving performance for stiff problems you can take a look at the docs.\nSensitivity analysis is provided by the SciMLSensitivity.jl package, which forms part of SciML’s differential equation suite. The model sensitivities are the derivatives of the solution with respect to the parameters. Specifically, the local sensitivity of the solution to a parameter is defined by how much the solution would change if the parameter were changed by a small amount. Sensitivity analysis provides a cheap way to calculate the gradient of the solution which can be used in parameter estimation and other optimization tasks. The sensitivity analysis methods in SciMLSensitivity.jl are based on automatic differentiation (AD), and are compatible with many of Julia’s AD backends. More details on the mathematical theory that underpins these methods can be found in the SciMLSensitivity documentation.\nTo enable sensitivity analysis, you will need to import SciMLSensitivity, and also use one of the AD backends that is compatible with SciMLSensitivity.jl when sampling. For example, if we wanted to use Mooncake.jl, we could run:\n\nimport Mooncake\nimport SciMLSensitivity\n\n# Define the AD backend to use\nadtype = AutoMooncake()\n\n# Sample a single chain with 1000 samples using Mooncake\nsample(model, NUTS(; adtype=adtype), 1000; progress=false)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.025\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×19×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 297.48 seconds\nCompute duration  = 297.48 seconds\nparameters        = α, β, γ, δ, q\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nIn this case, SciMLSensitivity will automatically choose an appropriate sensitivity analysis algorithm for you. You can also manually specify an algorithm by providing the sensealg keyword argument to the solve function; the existing algorithms are covered in this page of the SciMLSensitivity docs.\nFor more examples of adjoint usage on large parameter models, consult the DiffEqFlux documentation.",

    "text": "Basics\n\nIntroduction\nA probabilistic program is a Julia function wrapped in a @model macro. In this function, arbitrary Julia code can be used, but to ensure correctness of inference it should not have external effects or modify global state.\nTo specify distributions of random variables, Turing models use ~ notation: x ~ distr where x is an identifier. This resembles the notation used in statistical models. For example, the model:\n\\[\\begin{align}\na &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 1) \\\\\nx &\\sim \\text{Normal}(a, 1)\n\\end{align}\\]\nis written in Turing as:\nusing Turing\n\n@model function mymodel()\n    a ~ Normal(0, 1)\n    x ~ Normal(a, 1)\nend\n\n\nTilde-statements\nIndexing and field access is supported, so that x[i] ~ distr and x.field ~ distr are valid statements. However, in these cases, x must be defined in the scope of the model function. distr is typically either a distribution from Distributions.jl (see this page for implementing custom distributions), or another Turing model wrapped in to_submodel() (see this page for submodels).\nThere are two classes of tilde-statements: observe statements, where the left-hand side contains an observed value, and assume statements, where the left-hand side is not observed. These respectively correspond to likelihood and prior terms.\nIt is easier to start by explaining when a variable is treated as an observed value. This can happen in one of two ways:\n\nThe variable is passed as one of the arguments to the model function; or\nThe value of the variable in the model is explicitly conditioned or fixed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote that it is not enough for the variable to be defined in the current scope. For example, in\n@model function mymodel(x)\n    y = x + 1\n    y ~ Normal(0, 1)\nend\ny is not treated as an observed value.\n\n\nIn such a case, x is considered to be an observed value, assumed to have been drawn from the distribution distr. The likelihood (if needed) is computed using loglikelihood(distr, x).\nOn the other hand, if neither of the above are true, then this is treated as an assume-statement: inside the probabilistic program, this samples a new variable called x, distributed according to distr, and places it in the current scope.\n\n\nSimple Gaussian Demo\nBelow is a simple Gaussian demo illustrating the basic usage of Turing.jl.\n\n# Import packages.\nusing Turing\nusing StatsPlots\n\n# Define a simple Normal model with unknown mean and variance.\n@model function gdemo(x, y)\n    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))\n    x ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    return y ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\nend\n\ngdemo (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIn Turing.jl, MCMC sampling is performed using the sample() function, which (at its most basic) takes a model, a sampler, and the number of samples to draw.\nFor this model, the prior expectation of s² is mean(InverseGamma(2, 3)) = 3/(2 - 1) = 3, and the prior expectation of m is 0. We can check this using the Prior sampler:\n\nsetprogress!(false)\n\n\np1 = sample(gdemo(missing, missing), Prior(), 100000)\n\nChains MCMC chain (100000×7×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:100000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 100000\nWall duration     = 14.57 seconds\nCompute duration  = 14.57 seconds\nparameters        = s², m, x, y\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nTo perform inference, we simply need to specify the sampling algorithm we want to use.\n\n#  Run sampler, collect results.\nc1 = sample(gdemo(1.5, 2), SMC(), 1000)\nc2 = sample(gdemo(1.5, 2), PG(10), 1000)\nc3 = sample(gdemo(1.5, 2), HMC(0.1, 5), 1000)\nc4 = sample(gdemo(1.5, 2), Gibbs(:m =&gt; PG(10), :s² =&gt; HMC(0.1, 5)), 1000)\nc5 = sample(gdemo(1.5, 2), HMCDA(0.15, 0.65), 1000)\nc6 = sample(gdemo(1.5, 2), NUTS(0.65), 1000)\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 1.6\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.8\n\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×16×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 501:1:1500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 1.59 seconds\nCompute duration  = 1.59 seconds\nparameters        = s², m\ninternals         = n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size, lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nThe arguments for each sampler are:\n\nSMC: number of particles.\nPG: number of particles, number of iterations.\nHMC: leapfrog step size, leapfrog step numbers.\nGibbs: component sampler 1, component sampler 2, …\nHMCDA: total leapfrog length, target accept ratio.\nNUTS: number of adaptation steps (optional), target accept ratio.\n\nMore information about each sampler can be found in Turing.jl’s API docs.\nThe MCMCChains module (which is re-exported by Turing) provides plotting tools for the Chain objects returned by a sample function. See the MCMCChains repository for more information on the suite of tools available for diagnosing MCMC chains.\n# Summarise results\ndescribe(c3)\n\n# Plot results\nplot(c3)\nsavefig(\"gdemo-plot.png\")\n\n\nConditioning on data\nUsing this syntax, a probabilistic model is defined in Turing. The model function generated by Turing can then be used to condition the model on data. Subsequently, the sample function can be used to generate samples from the posterior distribution.\nIn the following example, the defined model is conditioned to the data (arg_1 = 1, arg_2 = 2) by passing the arguments 1 and 2 to the model function.\n@model function model_name(arg_1, arg_2)\n    arg_1 ~ ...\n    arg_2 ~ ...\nend\nThe conditioned model can then be passed onto the sample function to run posterior inference.\nmodel = model_name(1, 2)\nchn = sample(model, HMC(0.5, 20), 1000) # Sample with HMC.\nAlternatively, one can also use the conditioning operator | to condition the model on data. In this case, the model does not need to be defined with arg_1 and arg_2 as parameters.\n@model function model_name()\n    arg_1 ~ ...\n    arg_2 ~ ...\nend\n\n# Condition the model on data.\nmodel = model_name() | (arg_1 = 1, arg_2 = 2) \n\n\nAnalysing MCMC chains\nThe returned chain contains samples of the variables in the model.\nvar_1 = mean(chn[:var_1]) # Taking the mean of a variable named var_1.\nThe key (:var_1) can either be a Symbol or a String. For example, to fetch x[1], one can use chn[Symbol(\"x[1]\")] or chn[\"x[1]\"]. If you want to retrieve all parameters associated with a specific symbol, you can use group. As an example, if you have the parameters \"x[1]\", \"x[2]\", and \"x[3]\", calling group(chn, :x) or group(chn, \"x\") will return a new chain with only \"x[1]\", \"x[2]\", and \"x[3]\".\n\n\nTilde-statement ordering\nTuring does not have a declarative form. Thus, the ordering of tilde-statements in a Turing model is important: random variables cannot be used until they have been first declared in a tilde-statement. For example, the following example works:\n# Define a simple Normal model with unknown mean and variance.\n@model function model_function(y)\n    s ~ Poisson(1)\n    y ~ Normal(s, 1)\n    return y\nend\n\nsample(model_function(10), SMC(), 100)\nBut if we switch the s ~ Poisson(1) and y ~ Normal(s, 1) lines, the model will no longer sample correctly:\n# Define a simple Normal model with unknown mean and variance.\n@model function model_function(y)\n    y ~ Normal(s, 1)\n    s ~ Poisson(1)\n    return y\nend\n\nsample(model_function(10), SMC(), 100)\n\n\nSampling Multiple Chains\nTuring supports distributed and threaded parallel sampling. To do so, call sample(model, sampler, parallel_type, n, n_chains), where parallel_type can be either MCMCThreads() or MCMCDistributed() for thread and parallel sampling, respectively.\nHaving multiple chains in the same object is valuable for evaluating convergence. Some diagnostic functions like gelmandiag require multiple chains.\nIf you want to sample multiple chains without using parallelism, you can use MCMCSerial():\n# Sample 3 chains in a serial fashion.\nchains = sample(model, sampler, MCMCSerial(), 1000, 3)\nThe chains variable now contains a Chains object which can be indexed by chain. To pull out the first chain from the chains object, use chains[:,:,1]. The method is the same if you use either of the below parallel sampling methods.\n\nMultithreaded sampling\nIf you wish to perform multithreaded sampling, you can call sample with the following signature:\n# Sample four chains using multiple threads, each with 1000 samples.\nsample(model, sampler, MCMCThreads(), 1000, 4)\nBe aware that Turing cannot add threads for you – you must have started your Julia instance with multiple threads to experience any kind of parallelism. See the Julia documentation for details on how to achieve this.\n\n\nDistributed sampling\nTo perform distributed sampling (using multiple processes), you must first import Distributed.\nProcess parallel sampling can be done like so:\n\n# Load Distributed to add processes and the @everywhere macro.\nusing Distributed\n\n# Load Turing.\nusing Turing\n\n# Add four processes to use for sampling.\naddprocs(4; exeflags=\"--project=$(Base.active_project())\")\n\n# Initialize everything on all the processes.\n# Note: Make sure to do this after you've already loaded Turing,\n#       so each process does not have to precompile.\n#       Parallel sampling may fail silently if you do not do this.\n@everywhere using Turing\n\n# Define a model on all processes.\n@everywhere @model function gdemo(x)\n    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))\n\n    for i in eachindex(x)\n        x[i] ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    end\nend\n\n# Declare the model instance everywhere.\n@everywhere model = gdemo([1.5, 2.0])\n\n# Sample four chains using multiple processes, each with 1000 samples.\nsample(model, NUTS(), MCMCDistributed(), 1000, 4)\n\n\n\n\nSampling from an Unconditional Distribution (The Prior)\nTuring allows you to sample from a declared model’s prior. If you wish to draw a chain from the prior to inspect your prior distributions, you can run\n\nchain = sample(model, Prior(), n_samples)\n\nYou can also run your model (as if it were a function) from the prior distribution, by calling the model without specifying inputs or a sampler. In the below example, we specify a gdemo model which returns two variables, x and y. Here, including the return statement is necessary to retrieve the sampled x and y values.\n\n@model function gdemo(x, y)\n    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))\n    x ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    y ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    return x, y\nend\n\ngdemo (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nTo produce a sample from the prior distribution, we instantiate the model with missing inputs:\n\n# Samples from p(x,y)\ng_prior_sample = gdemo(missing, missing)\ng_prior_sample()\n\n(-0.7061622013334035, 0.23098908699126083)\n\n\n\n\nSampling from a Conditional Distribution (The Posterior)\n\nTreating observations as random variables\nInputs to the model that have a value missing are treated as parameters, aka random variables, to be estimated/sampled. This can be useful if you want to simulate draws for that parameter, or if you are sampling from a conditional distribution. Turing supports the following syntax:\n\n@model function gdemo(x, ::Type{T}=Float64) where {T}\n    if x === missing\n        # Initialize `x` if missing\n        x = Vector{T}(undef, 2)\n    end\n    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))\n    for i in eachindex(x)\n        x[i] ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    end\nend\n\n# Construct a model with x = missing\nmodel = gdemo(missing)\nc = sample(model, HMC(0.05, 20), 500)\n\nChains MCMC chain (500×16×1 reshape(::Matrix{Union{Missing, Float64}}, 500, 16, 1) with eltype Union{Missing, Float64}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 500\nWall duration     = 3.76 seconds\nCompute duration  = 3.76 seconds\nparameters        = s², m, x[1], x[2]\ninternals         = hamiltonian_energy, n_steps, numerical_error, loglikelihood, hamiltonian_energy_error, is_accept, logprior, log_density, step_size, acceptance_rate, lp, nom_step_size\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nNote the need to initialize x when missing since we are iterating over its elements later in the model. The generated values for x can be extracted from the Chains object using c[:x].\nTuring also supports mixed missing and non-missing values in x, where the missing ones will be treated as random variables to be sampled while the others get treated as observations. For example:\n\n@model function gdemo(x)\n    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))\n    for i in eachindex(x)\n        x[i] ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    end\nend\n\n# x[1] is a parameter, but x[2] is an observation\nmodel = gdemo([missing, 2.4])\nc = sample(model, HMC(0.01, 5), 500)\n\nChains MCMC chain (500×15×1 reshape(::Matrix{Union{Missing, Float64}}, 500, 15, 1) with eltype Union{Missing, Float64}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:500\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 500\nWall duration     = 2.34 seconds\nCompute duration  = 2.34 seconds\nparameters        = s², m, x[1]\ninternals         = hamiltonian_energy, n_steps, numerical_error, loglikelihood, hamiltonian_energy_error, is_accept, logprior, log_density, step_size, acceptance_rate, lp, nom_step_size\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Values\nArguments to Turing models can have default values much like how default values work in normal Julia functions. For instance, the following will assign missing to x and treat it as a random variable. If the default value is not missing, x will be assigned that value and will be treated as an observation instead.\n\nusing Turing\n\n@model function generative(x=missing, ::Type{T}=Float64) where {T&lt;:Real}\n    if x === missing\n        # Initialize x when missing\n        x = Vector{T}(undef, 10)\n    end\n    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))\n    for i in 1:length(x)\n        x[i] ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))\n    end\n    return s², m\nend\n\nm = generative()\nchain = sample(m, HMC(0.01, 5), 1000)\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×24×1 reshape(::Matrix{Union{Missing, Float64}}, 1000, 24, 1) with eltype Union{Missing, Float64}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:1000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 2.59 seconds\nCompute duration  = 2.59 seconds\nparameters        = s², m, x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], x[5], x[6], x[7], x[8], x[9], x[10]\ninternals         = hamiltonian_energy, n_steps, numerical_error, loglikelihood, hamiltonian_energy_error, is_accept, logprior, log_density, step_size, acceptance_rate, lp, nom_step_size\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\n\nAccess Values inside Chain\nYou can access the values inside a chain in several ways:\n\nTurn them into a DataFrame object\nUse their raw AxisArray form\nCreate a three-dimensional Array object\n\nFor example, let c be a Chain:\n\nDataFrame(c) converts c to a DataFrame,\nc.value retrieves the values inside c as an AxisArray, and\nc.value.data retrieves the values inside c as a 3D Array.\n\n\n\nVariable Types and Type Parameters\nThe element type of a vector (or matrix) of random variables should match the eltype of its prior distribution, i.e., &lt;: Integer for discrete distributions and &lt;: AbstractFloat for continuous distributions.\nSome automatic differentiation backends (used in conjunction with Hamiltonian samplers such as HMC or NUTS) further require that the vector’s element type needs to either be:\n\nReal to enable auto-differentiation through the model which uses special number types that are sub-types of Real, or\nSome type parameter T defined in the model header using the type parameter syntax, e.g. function gdemo(x, ::Type{T} = Float64) where {T}.\n\nSimilarly, when using a particle sampler, the Julia variable used should either be:\n\nAn Array, or\nAn instance of some type parameter T defined in the model header using the type parameter syntax, e.g. function gdemo(x, ::Type{T} = Vector{Float64}) where {T}.\n\n\n\n\nQuerying Probabilities from Model or Chain\nTuring offers three functions: loglikelihood, logprior, and logjoint to query the log-likelihood, log-prior, and log-joint probabilities of a model, respectively.\nLet’s look at a simple model called gdemo:\n\n@model function gdemo0()\n    s ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)\n    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s))\n    return x ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s))\nend\n\ngdemo0 (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we observe x to be 1.0, we can condition the model on this datum using the condition syntax:\n\nmodel = gdemo0() | (x=1.0,)\n\nDynamicPPL.Model{typeof(gdemo0), (), (), (), Tuple{}, Tuple{}, DynamicPPL.ConditionContext{@NamedTuple{x::Float64}, DynamicPPL.DefaultContext}}(gdemo0, NamedTuple(), NamedTuple(), ConditionContext((x = 1.0,), DynamicPPL.DefaultContext()))\n\n\nNow, let’s compute the log-likelihood of the observation given specific values of the model parameters, s and m:\n\nloglikelihood(model, (s=1.0, m=1.0))\n\n-0.9189385332046728\n\n\nWe can easily verify that value in this case:\n\nlogpdf(Normal(1.0, 1.0), 1.0)\n\n-0.9189385332046728\n\n\nWe can also compute the log-prior probability of the model for the same values of s and m:\n\nlogprior(model, (s=1.0, m=1.0))\n\n-2.221713955868453\n\n\n\nlogpdf(InverseGamma(2, 3), 1.0) + logpdf(Normal(0, sqrt(1.0)), 1.0)\n\n-2.221713955868453\n\n\nFinally, we can compute the log-joint probability of the model parameters and data:\n\nlogjoint(model, (s=1.0, m=1.0))\n\n-3.1406524890731258\n\n\n\nlogpdf(Normal(1.0, 1.0), 1.0) +\nlogpdf(InverseGamma(2, 3), 1.0) +\nlogpdf(Normal(0, sqrt(1.0)), 1.0)\n\n-3.1406524890731258\n\n\nQuerying with Chains object is easy as well:\n\nchn = sample(model, Prior(), 10)\n\nChains MCMC chain (10×5×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:10\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 10\nWall duration     = 0.79 seconds\nCompute duration  = 0.79 seconds\nparameters        = s, m\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\n\nloglikelihood(model, chn)\n\n10×1 Matrix{Float64}:\n -1.9648280301310792\n -1.246869661029642\n -2.2487610856907536\n -2.6422478613578506\n -1.4646917107167552\n -1.3684412823926955\n -1.3437013553957389\n -1.0865273056142601\n -1.7371190523998432\n -3.0120958477789332\n\n\n\n\nMaximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates\nTuring also has functions for estimating the maximum a posteriori and maximum likelihood parameters of a model.

    "text": "Beyond the Basics\n\nCompositional Sampling Using Gibbs\nTuring.jl provides a Gibbs interface to combine different samplers. For example, one can combine an HMC sampler with a PG sampler to run inference for different parameters in a single model as below.\n\n@model function simple_choice(xs)\n    p ~ Beta(2, 2)\n    z ~ Bernoulli(p)\n    for i in 1:length(xs)\n        if z == 1\n            xs[i] ~ Normal(0, 1)\n        else\n            xs[i] ~ Normal(2, 1)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nsimple_choice_f = simple_choice([1.5, 2.0, 0.3])\n\nchn = sample(simple_choice_f, Gibbs(:p =&gt; HMC(0.2, 3), :z =&gt; PG(20)), 1000)\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×5×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:1000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 32.39 seconds\nCompute duration  = 32.39 seconds\nparameters        = p, z\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nUse `describe(chains)` for summary statistics and quantiles.\n\n\nThe Gibbs sampler can be used to specify unique automatic differentiation backends for different variable spaces. Please see the Automatic Differentiation article for more.\nFor more details of compositional sampling in Turing.jl, please check the corresponding paper.\n\n\nWorking with filldist and arraydist\nTuring provides filldist(dist::Distribution, n::Int) and arraydist(dists::AbstractVector{&lt;:Distribution}) as a simplified interface to construct product distributions, e.g., to model a set of variables that share the same structure but vary by group.\n\nConstructing product distributions with filldist\nThe function filldist provides a general interface to construct product distributions over distributions of the same type and parameterisation. Note that, in contrast to the product distribution interface provided by Distributions.jl (Product), filldist supports product distributions over univariate or multivariate distributions.\nExample usage:\n\n@model function demo(x, g)\n    k = length(unique(g))\n    a ~ filldist(Exponential(), k) # = Product(fill(Exponential(), k))\n    mu = a[g]\n    for i in eachindex(x)\n        x[i] ~ Normal(mu[i])\n    end\n    return mu\nend\n\ndemo (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n\nConstructing product distributions with arraydist\nThe function arraydist provides a general interface to construct product distributions over distributions of varying type and parameterisation. Note that in contrast to the product distribution interface provided by Distributions.jl (Product), arraydist supports product distributions over univariate or multivariate distributions.\nExample usage:\n\n@model function demo(x, g)\n    k = length(unique(g))\n    a ~ arraydist([Exponential(i) for i in 1:k])\n    mu = a[g]\n    for i in eachindex(x)\n        x[i] ~ Normal(mu[i])\n    end\n    return mu\nend\n\ndemo (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with MCMCChains.jl\nTuring.jl wraps its samples using MCMCChains.Chain so that all the functions working for MCMCChains.Chain can be re-used in Turing.jl. Two typical functions are MCMCChains.describe and MCMCChains.plot, which can be used as follows for an obtained chain chn. For more information on MCMCChains, please see the GitHub repository.\n\ndescribe(chn) # Lists statistics of the samples.\nplot(chn) # Plots statistics of the samples.\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (1000×5×1 Array{Float64, 3}):\n\nIterations        = 1:1:1000\nNumber of chains  = 1\nSamples per chain = 1000\nWall duration     = 32.39 seconds\nCompute duration  = 32.39 seconds\nparameters        = p, z\ninternals         = lp, logprior, loglikelihood\n\nSummary Statistics\n  parameters      mean       std      mcse   ess_bulk   ess_tail      rhat   e ⋯\n      Symbol   Float64   Float64   Float64    Float64    Float64   Float64     ⋯\n\n           p    0.4491    0.2118    0.0204   107.0940   165.3816    1.0074     ⋯\n           z    0.1690    0.3749    0.0219   293.1185        NaN    1.0002     ⋯\n                                                                1 column omitted\n\nQuantiles\n  parameters      2.5%     25.0%     50.0%     75.0%     97.5%\n      Symbol   Float64   Float64   Float64   Float64   Float64\n\n           p    0.0770    0.2884    0.4429    0.5991    0.8511\n           z    0.0000    0.0000    0.0000    0.0000    1.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are numerous functions in addition to describe and plot in the MCMCChains package, such as those used in convergence diagnostics. For more information on the package, please see the GitHub repository.\n\n\nChanging Default Settings\nSome of Turing.jl’s default settings can be changed for better usage.\n\nAD Backend\nTuring is thoroughly tested with three automatic differentiation (AD) backend packages. The default AD backend is ForwardDiff, which uses forward-mode AD. Two reverse-mode AD backends are also supported, namely Mooncake and ReverseDiff. Mooncake and ReverseDiff also require the user to explicitly load them using import Mooncake or import ReverseDiff next to using Turing.\nFor more information on Turing’s automatic differentiation backend, please see the Automatic Differentiation article as well as the ADTests website, where a number of AD backends (not just those above) are tested against Turing.jl.\n\n\nProgress Logging\nTuring.jl uses ProgressLogging.jl to log the sampling progress. Progress logging is enabled as default but might slow down inference. It can be turned on or off by setting the keyword argument progress of sample to true or false. Moreover, you can enable or disable progress logging globally by calling setprogress!(true) or setprogress!(false), respectively.\nTuring uses heuristics to select an appropriate visualization backend. If you use Jupyter notebooks, the default backend is ConsoleProgressMonitor.jl. In all other cases, progress logs are displayed with TerminalLoggers.jl. Alternatively, if you provide a custom visualization backend, Turing uses it instead of the default backend.",

It also cleans up the list of exported identifiers, and most notably, if you were using things from DynamicPPL, you will now also need to import DynamicPPL (or using).\nMore generally, it’s likely that from now on our releases will involve larger changes because we are aggregating more changes into a single minor version. We are, however, also committed to providing thorough release notes that will help users and library authors upgrade more easily! Release notes will be available on GitHub, and you can see the notes for Turing 0.37 and DynamicPPL 0.35 here. If you have any trouble upgrading, just drop us a note.\nAD backend testing\nRight now we test a series of DynamicPPL models with several AD backends. It’s rather ad-hoc and we are currently drafting a more formal interface for testing AD backends with Turing models. It’s still early days but if you are an AD package developer and want to know what this means for integration with Turing, get in touch (easiest way: ping Penny on Slack) 🙂\nUnified interface for optimisation algorithms\nThere’s an ongoing discussion about unifying the interface for MAP/MLE point estimates and variational inference (and potentially even MCMC). If you use more than one of these methods and have thoughts on what you’d like from an interface, we’d be very happy to hear from you!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Turing.jl newsletter!\nWhat is this?!\nHi everyone! We (the Turing.jl team) are starting a fortnightly series of updates on what we’ve been up to and what’s in the works. We hope that this will provide you (our users) with some insight into the direction of the Turing ecosystem, and we’d also love for you to chip in with your thoughts if you have any.\nYou can keep up with the newsletter either on this website, on the #turing channel in Julia Slack, or by subscribing to our issue on GitHub. We might post to other places too (like Discourse), this is still in the works!\nNew Turing behaviour, especially .~\nRecently we have been focused on reworking a number of internal data structures in DynamicPPL.jl (this is the package that allows you to define models). We haven’t released this yet but you might be interested to see the changelog on GitHub. The main user-facing changes here are the simplification of broadcasted tilde .~ , which we previously posted about on Slack here. We also fixed a bug where the prefixes of nested submodels were applied in the wrong order.\nDifferentiationInterface migration\nFrom a developer perspective, we have now fully switched over to DifferentiationInterface.jl for automatic differentiation of models occurs. This work of course couldn’t have been possible without Guillaume Dalle’s work on DI itself and also his help with integrating it into DynamicPPL. This also paves the way for a long-standing goal of Turing, which is to expose a series of AD testing utilities that will allow AD package developers to test against a fixed set of models — this will allow us to formalise the idea of Turing being ‘compatible’ with a given AD package.\nThe plan for submodels\nWe have been discussing for a while now about how best to fully implement submodels (i.e. be able to treat submodels like distributions in the sense that we can sample from them, and also condition models on values obtained from submodels). There is currently a proposal which we’ve written up on GitHub, and goes into more depth about what we’d like to see and the underlying syntax. If this is a Turing feature that you use, do feel free to let us know what you think.\nTuring.jl is now published (again!)\nWe recently published a new paper with a high-level overview of Turing.jl’s features and implementation.

We’re currently putting together a list of papers and other outputs (e.g. tutorials, presentations, …) which make use of Turing.jl. We’d love to have more examples, if you have any, please do get in touch (feel free to message me and I can forward it). Thank you!\nState of the AD\nOver the last few weeks we’ve been putting together a little project that tabulates the performance of different AD backends on a variety of Turing.jl models, and we’re now quite excited to share it: https://turinglang.org/ADTests/ This will hopefully help to answer the perennial question of whether you should stick with good old ForwardDiff, or whether you should try something else. Do note that (as of the time of writing) this table is still in alpha stage and there are a lot of details that have yet to be ironed out :slightly_smiling_face: However, suggestions are always welcome!\nJuliaBUGS.jl\nThe BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) language provides a declarative way to specify complex Bayesian statistical models. For years, implementations like WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, and JAGS have been widely used tools for researchers applying these models. JuliaBUGS.jl is a modern implementation of the BUGS language, aiming for full backwards compatibility with standard BUGS models, while also offering improved interoperability with the Julia ecosystem. (For details and examples of BUGS syntax, check out the JuliaBUGS documentation.)\nA recent experimental update introduces significant performance improvements in JuliaBUGS: instead of relying solely on the previous graph-based approach, JuliaBUGS can now directly generate Julia code to compute the model’s log-density. This code generation technique can yield &gt;10x speedups compared to the graph-based method. Currently, this provides the most benefit for models with linear or hierarchical structures; support for state space models is planned for a future update.\nTo use it, run this after compiling your model:\nJuliaBUGS.set_evaluation_mode(your_model, JuliaBUGS.UseGeneratedLogDensityFunction())\nWe would love for you to test out this new functionality! If you have any feedback, please do feel free to open a GitHub issue or discussion.\nEven more advanced HMC\nLastly, we have a paper of our own to share on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods!\n\nXu, K., & Ge, H.

    "title": "Replication study: Estimating number of infections and impact of NPIs on COVID-19 in European countries (Imperial Report 13)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Turing.jl team is currently exploring possibilities in an attempt to help with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 crisis. As preparation for this and to get our feet wet, we decided to perform a replication study of the Imperial Report 13, which attempts to estimate the real number of infections and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19. In the report, the inference was performed using the probabilistic programming language (PPL) Stan. We have explicated their model and inference in Turing.jl, a Julia-based PPL. We believe the results and analysis of our study are relevant for the public, and for other researchers who are actively working on epidemiological models. To that end, our implementation and results are available here.\nIn summary, we replicated the Imperial COVID-19 model using Turing.jl. Subsequently, we compared the inference results between Turing and Stan, and our comparison indicates that results are reproducible with two different implementations. In particular, we performed 4 sets of simulations using the Imperial COVID-19 model. The resulting estimates of the expected real number of cases, in contrast to the recorded number of cases, the reproduction number \\(R_t\\), and the expected number of deaths as a function of time and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for each Simulation are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (a): hypothetical Simulation from the model without data (prior predictive) or non-pharmaceutical interventions. Under the prior assumptions of the Imperial Covid-19 model, there is a very wide range of epidemic progressions with expected cases from almost 0 to 100% of the population over time. The black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation. Note that \\(R_t\\) has a different time-range than the other plots; following the original report, this shows the 100 days following the country-specific epidemic_start which is defined to be 31 days prior to the first date of 10 cumulative deaths, while the other plots show the last 60 days.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (b): future Simulation with non-pharmaceutical interventions kept in place (posterior predictive). After incorporating the observed infection data, we can see a substantially more refined range of epidemic progression. The reproduction rate estimate lies in the range of 3.5-5.6 before any intervention is introduced. The dotted lines correspond to observations, and the black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (c): future Simulation with non-pharmaceutical interventions removed. Now we see the hypothetical scenarios after incorporating infection data, but with non-pharmaceutical interventions removed. This plot looks similar to Simulation (a), but with a more rapid progression of the pandemic since the estimated reproduction rate is bigger than the prior assumptions. The dotted lines correspond to observations, and the black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation (d): future Simulation with when lockdown is lifted two weeks before the last observation (predictive posterior). As a result there is a clear, rapid rebound of the reproduction rate. Comparing with Simulation (b) we do not observe an immediate increase in the number of expected cases and deaths upon lifting lockdown, but there is a significant difference in the number of cases and deaths in the last few days in the plot: Simulation (d) results in both greater number of cases and deaths, as expected. This demonstrates how the effects of lifting an intervention might not become apparent in the measurable variables, e.g. deaths, until several weeks later. The dotted lines correspond to observations, the black bar corresponds to the date of the last observation, and the red bar indicates when lockdown was lifted.\nOverall, Simulation (a) shows the prior modelling assumptions, and how these prior assumptions determine the predicted number of cases, etc. before seeing any data. Simulation (b) predicts the trend of the number of cases, etc. using estimated parameters and by keeping all the non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. Simulation (c) shows the estimate in the case where none of the intervention measures are ever put in place. Simulation (d) shows the estimates in the case when the lockdown was lifted two weeks prior to the last observation while keeping all the other non-pharmaceutical interventions in place.\nWe want to emphasise that we do not provide additional analysis of the Imperial model yet, nor are we aiming to make any claims about the validity or the implications of the model. Instead we refer to Imperial Report 13 for more details and analysis. The purpose of this post is solely to add validation to the inference performed in the paper by obtaining the same results using a different probabilistic programming language (PPL) and by exploring whether or not Turing.jl can be useful for researchers working on these problems.\nFor our next steps, we’re looking at collaboration with other researchers and further developments of this and similar models. There are some immediate directions to explore:\n\nIncorporation of more sources of data, e.g. national mobility, seasonal changes and behavior changes in individuals.\nHow the assumptions incorporated into the priors and their parameters change resulting posterior.\nThe current model does not directly include recovery as a possibility and assumes that if a person has been infected once then he/she will be infectious until death. Number of recovered cases suffers from the same issues as the number of cases: it cannot be directly observed. But we can also deal with it in a similar manner as is done with number of cases and incorporate this into the model for a potential improvement. This will result in a plethora of different models from which we can select the most realistic one using different model comparison techniques, e.g. leave-one-out cross-validation (loo-cv).\n\nSuch model refinement can be potentially valuable given the high impact of this pandemic and the uncertainty and debates in the potential outcomes.\nAcknowledgement We would like to thank the Julia community for creating such an excellent platform for scientific computing, and for the continuous feedback that we have received. We also thank researchers from Computational and Biological Laboratory at Cambridge University for their feedback on an early version of the post. \n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "DynamicPPL 0.36\nA new minor version of DynamicPPL brings with it a few changes especially to the behaviour of submodels. These have not yet percolated up to Turing.jl, but will soon be. Firstly, prefixing behaviour is changed: consider these models\n@model function inner()\n    x ~ Normal()\nend\n@model function outer()\n    a = [0.0]\n    a[1] ~ to_submodel(inner())\nend\nIf you ran this model, you would find that the single random variable was called a[1].x — but this isn’t the x field of the 1st element of a, it’s actually a variable whose name is literally just Symbol(\"a[1].x\"). DynamicPPL changes this behaviour such that the variable is correctly recognised as the x field of the 1st element of a. This means that if you are trying to, for example, condition on the variable, you can do:\nouter() | (@varname(a[1].x) =&gt; 1.0)\nOn the topic of conditioning, you can now also correctly condition or fix variables in a model before using it as a submodel, as this example demonstrates:\n@model function inner()\n    x ~ Normal()\nend\n@model function outer()\n    a ~ to_submodel(inner() | (@varname(x) =&gt; 1))\nend\nPreviously, if you wanted to do this, you would have to condition on @varname(a.x), meaning that you’d need to know the prefix before conditioning it. The current system allows for more modular construction of nested models.\nFor more complete details, please see the release notes.\nTuringBenchmarking.jl\nDynamicPPL 0.36 also brings new functionality that can be used for testing and benchmarking automatic differentiation on Turing models. This is what powers the ADTests table, which we shared last time round. (Psst — there are more examples now than before!)\nFor more information, see the docstring of DynamicPPL.TestUtils.AD.run_ad in the DynamicPPL docs.\nAs a corollary of this, the AD benchmarking functionalities in TuringBenchmarking.jl are not really needed anymore. If you are using this package, we recommend that you switch over to use the functionality that’s directly built into DynamicPPL.\nAdvancedHMC compatibility with ComponentArrays\nAdvancedHMC had a fairly long-standing issue where it couldn’t always be used with ComponentArrays as the position / momentum. This has now been fixed; you can take a look at the test suite to see examples of how they can be used together.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

It also contains a fix for the Gibbs sampler, so that you can now specify arbitrary VarNames for each sampler (previously, you could only specify single-symbol VarNames). For example, you can now specify the a.x and b.x VarNames here:\n@model function inner()\n    x ~ Normal()\nend\n@model function outer()\n    a ~ to_submodel(inner())\n    b ~ to_submodel(inner())\nend\nsample(outer(), Gibbs(@varname(a.x) =&gt; MH(), @varname(b.x) =&gt; MH()), 100)\nIt is theoretically possible that this will be slow for VarNames that involve indexing (e.g. x[1]), although we don’t have an example of this yet.

All of these probabilities are also consistently returned in the “unlinked space”, i.e., they don’t include any Jacobian terms obtained from transforming constrained distributions (these terms are an implementation detail and shouldn’t be ‘leaked’ to the user).

It is the package that determines how to analyze and store MCMC samples provided by packages like Turing. It’s also used outside of Turing.\nFor this project, a student might improve the performance of the various statistical functions provided by MCMCChains, changing the back end to use a data storage format that maintains the shape of parameter samples, or improve the general plotting functionality of the package.\nThere’s lots of fun little things to do for MCMCChains. Check out this meta-issue for more details and discussions.\n\n\nParticle filtering methods\nMentors: Hong Ge, Cameron Pfiffer\nProject difficulty: Medium\nDescription: Turing’s support for particle sampling methods is slowing being improved with the addition of AdvancedPS.jl. If you’re interested in implementing or improving particle sampling methods, this is a great project for you!\n\n\nNested Sampling\nMentors: Miles Lucas, Cameron Pfiffer, Hong Ge\nProject difficulty: Hard\nDescription: NestedSamplers.jl is an excellent package which implements nested sampling methods. As of yet, it is not connected to Turing.jl. For this project, a student would connect the NestedSamplers.jl library to Turing.jl.\n\n\nGPU acceleration\nMentors: Mohamed Tarek, Hong Ge, Kai Xu, Tor Fjelde\nProject difficulty: Medium\nDescription: Turing’s native GPU support is limited in that the Metropolis-Hastings and HMC samplers do not implement GPU sampling methods. This can and should be done – GPU methods are awesome! If you are interested with working on parallelism and GPUs, this project is for you.\nStudents will work with the code at AdvancedMH or AdvancedHMC, depending on their interests.\n\n\nDocumentation and tutorial improvements\nMentors: Cameron Pfiffer, Martin Trapp\nProject difficulty: Easy\nDescription: Turing’s documentation and tutorials need a bit of an overhaul. Turing has changed significantly since the last time the documentation was written, and it’s beginning to show. Students would use their knowledge of probabilistic programming languages and Turing to shore-up or rewrite documentation and tutorials.\n\n\nIterative Methods for Inference in Gaussian Processes\nMentors: Will Tebbutt, S. T. John, Theo Galy-Fajou\nProject difficulty: Medium\nDescription: There has recently been quite a bit of work on inference methods for GPs that use iterative methods rather than the Cholesky factorisation. They look quite promising, but no one has implemented any of these within the Julia GP ecosystem yet, but they should fit nicely within the AbstractGPs framework. If you’re interested in improving the GP ecosystem in Julia, this project might be for you!\n\n\nImplement advanced variational Gaussian process models\nMentors: ST John, Will Tebbutt, Theo Galy-Fajou\nProject difficulty: Easy to Medium\nDescription: Sparse variational Gaussian process models provide the flexibility to scale to large datasets, handle arbitrary (non-conjugate) likelihoods, and to be used as building blocks for composite models such as deep GPs. This project is about making such models more readily available within the Julia GP ecosystem - depending on your interests you can focus on making it easier for end users and providing good tutorials, or on the implementations of these models to give us the same or better performance as with established Python packages such as GPflow, integrating with Flux.jl, etc.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Turing plans to participate in the upcoming GSoC, and we wanted to outline some potential projects and expectations we have for applicants.\nIf you are not aware, Google provides funds to students around the world to develop a project of their choice over the summer. Students receive funds from Google and spend three months on any open source project.\nThe Turing development team has prepared a list of possible projects that we have deemed valuable to the project and easy enough that it could feasibly be created in the three-month limit. This list is not exclusive – if you have a good idea, you can write it up in your proposal, though it is recommend that you reach out to any of the Turing team on Julia’s Slack (you can get an invite here) or Discourse. Messages on Discourse should be posted to the “Probabilistic programming” category – we’ll find you!\nPossible project ideas:\n\nBenchmarking. Turing’s performance has been sporadically benchmarked against various other probabilistic programming languages (e.g. Turing, Stan, PyMC3, TensorFlow Prob), but a systemic approach to studying where Turing excels and where it falls short would be useful. A GSoC student would implement identical models in many PPLs and build tools to benchmark all PPLs against one another.\nNested sampling integration. Turing focuses on modularity in inference methods, and the development team would like to see more inference methods, particularly the popular nested sampling method. A Julia package (NestedSamplers.jl) but it is not hooked up to Turing and does not currently have a stable API. A GSoC student would either integrate that package or construct their own nested sampling method and build it into Turing.\nAutomated function memoization by model annotation. Function memoization is a way to reduce costly function evaluation by caching the output when the same inputs are given. Turing’s Gibbs sampler often ends up rerunning expensive functions multiple times, and it would be a significant performance improvement to allow Turing’s model compiler to automatically memoize functions where appropriate. A student working on this project would become intimately familiar with Turing’s model compiler and build in various automated improvements.\nMaking Distributions GPU compatible. Julia’s GPU tooling is generally quite good, but currently Turing is not able to reliably use GPUs while sampling because Distributions.jl is not GPU compatible. A student on this project would work with the Turing developers and the Distributions developers to allow the use of GPU parallelism where possible in Turing.\nStatic distributions. Small, fixed-size vectors and matrices are fairly common in Turing models. This means that sampling in Turing can probably benefit from using statically sized vectors and matrices from StaticArrays.jl instead of the dynamic normal Julia arrays. Beside the often superior performance of small static vectors and matrices, static arrays are also automatically compatible with the GPU stack in Julia. Currently, the main obstacle to using StaticArrays.jl is that distributions in Distributions.jl are not compatible with StaticArrays. A GSoC student would adapt the multivariate and matrix-variate distributions as well as the univariate distribution with vector parameters in Distributions.jl to make a spin-off package called StaticDistributions.jl. The student would then benchmark StaticDistributions.jl against Distributions.jl and showcase an example of using StaticDistributions.jl together with CuArrays.jl and/or CUDAnative.jl for GPU-acceleration.\nGPnet extensions. One of Turing’s satellite packages, GPnet, is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of Gaussian process tools. See this issue for potential tasks – there’s a lot of interesting stuff going on with GPs, and this task in particular may have some creative freedom to it.\nBetter chains and model diagnostics. One package that Turing (and many others) rely on heavily is MCMCChains.jl, a package designed to format, store, and analyze parameter samples generated during MCMC inference. MCMCChains is currently showing its age a little and has many bad design choices that need to be fixed. Alternatively, a student could construct a far more lightweight chain system.\nModel comparison tools. Turing and its satellite packages do not currently provide a comprehensive suite of model comparison tools, a critical tool for the applied statistician. A student who worked on this project would implement various model comparison tools like LOO and WAIC, among others.\nMLE/MAP tools. Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates can currently only be done by users through a clunky set of workarounds. A streamlined function like mle(model) or map(model) would be very useful for many of Turing’s users who want to see what the MLE or MAP estimates look like, and it may be valuable to allow for functionality that allows MCMC sampling to begin from the MLE or MAP estimates. Students working on this project will work with optimization packages such as Optim.jl to make MLE and MAP estimation straightforward for Turing models.\nParticle sampler improvements. Turing’s development team has spent a lot of time and energy to make inference methods more modular, but Turing’s particle samplers have not yet been modernized and spun off into a separate package. Two packages that resulted from this were AdvancedHMC for Hamiltonian MCMC methods, and AdvancedMH for Metropolis-Hastings style inference methods. A student who worked on this project would become very familiar with Turing’s inference backend and with particle sampling methods. This is a good project for people who love making things efficient and easily extendable.\n\nOther projects are welcome, but we do strongly recommend discussing any potential projects with members of the Turing team, as they will end up mentoring GSoC students for the duration of the project.\nWe’re looking forward to what people are interested in!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Particle samplers (SMC and PG) currently do not work on 1.12, and Enzyme and Mooncake will both not run. Fixes are being worked on, but it may well take until 1.12.1 before everything is in order. If you use any of the above three, you may want to stay with 1.11 for now.\nJuliaCon\nWe were at JuliaCon Paris last week (thanks to the organising team for a wonderful conference)! If you didn’t get the chance to say hi, feel free to take a look at the poster we did here on GitHub. It very briefly summarises what we’ve been up to in the last few months, what our current priorities are, and what’s likely to come in the future.\nMCMCChains plots + stats\nIn the past few months there have been a number of new plot types added to MCMCChains. You can see examples of energy plots, violin plots, and posterior predictive plots in the docs. Also, you can now use MCMCDiagnosticTools.bfmi(::Chains) to calculate the Bayesian fraction of missing information.\nDocs\nThere’s a new page explaining in more detail all the options you can use when sampling: https://turinglang.org/docs/usage/sampling-options/, suggestions for additions are always welcome!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The major update this week is the release of Turing.jl v0.39. The biggest change is the update to AdvancedVI 0.4, and corresponding changes in Turing’s VI interface. We’re still working on bringing all the docs up to date, but here’s what you can expect from the new version:\n\nlocation-scale families with dense scale matrices,\nparameter-free stochastic optimization algorithms like DoG and DoWG,\nproximal operators for stable optimization,\nthe sticking-the-landing control variate for faster convergence, and\nthe score gradient estimator for non-differentiable targets.\n\nThere are some other small changes to do with imports and exports. The brief summary is: @addlogprob! is now formally exported. There are a bunch of other, unexported, things where you may need to change from Turing.foo to DynamicPPL.foo – although this probably only applies if you were using DynamicPPL internals. If you have any issues with these please feel free to get in touch.\nApart from this, we have also released AdvancedHMC.jl 0.8! Breaking changes include: - if you are relying the internal transition to make an MCMC transition from phase point z using trajectory τ (or HMCKernel κ) with Hamiltonian h, please note the signature has changed. The usage should now always be transition(h, τ, z) or transition(h, κ, z). - HMC sampling requires appropriate step size for the Leapfrog integration, as the chosen step size directly affects the numerical stability of the integration process. While AdvancedHMC.jl provides find_good_stepsize to find a suitable step size during HMC sampling, it didn’t support manual step size specification, which caused unnecessary searching. Now initial_step_size can be specified as a keyword in find_good_stepsize if you want more control of the step size selection process.\nAnd finally, we have a few new examples of normalising flows in the NormalizingFlows.jl library: https://github.com/TuringLang/NormalizingFlows.jl/tree/main/example\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "DynamicPPL benchmarking\nDynamicPPL.jl now has a set of benchmarks that are run on GitHub Actions! We measure how long it takes to evaluate a small selection of models and also to run AD on them. If you think that there are specific models / features that we should add to the benchmarks, please feel free to create an issue and let us know.\nSeparately, we are planning to merge the benchmarking utilities in TuringBenchmarking.jl into DynamicPPL itself. There might be a little bit of API shake-up as part of this, but it’s for the better as it’ll allow the benchmarking code to more easily stay in sync with DynamicPPL — allowing us to catch performance regressions in PRs.\nSSMProblems\nThe SSMProblems.jl and GeneralisedFilters.jl packages have now been merged into a single repository: https://github.com/TuringLang/SSMProblems.jl. This won’t affect you if you are using the packages from the Julia General registry, but if you’re looking to develop off the main branch you may have to use a different URL, or specify a subdirectory in Pkg.add.\nSmaller bits\nOther code changes that have been merged:\n\nSome old code in AdvancedHMC.jl has been cleaned up quite a bit. See the 0.7.0 release for more information.\nTuring’s Gibbs sampler now supports warmup steps properly. We’re still thinking about how to properly encode the scenario where different sub-samplers have different numbers of warmup steps, if you have any ideas, do get in touch on that PR.\nWe are going to formally remove support for Zygote as an AD backend. We don’t test it thoroughly in Turing’s test suite. You can of course still use Zygote yourself, simply load ADTypes.AutoZygote() — although we can’t guarantee that we will fix any bugs that arise.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

There are (as always) plenty of things for us to work through, but if you’ve used this and would like to let us know about what you’d like to see in it, feel free to message or open an issue on the repository!\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "MCMCChains@7\nThere’s a new major version of MCMCChains.jl. From a user point of view, the main difference is that summary statistics and quantiles aren’t automatically calculated by default (so, printing a Chains object in a REPL will only show the parameter names and sizes). To get the summary statistics and quantiles you will have to run describe(chain). The main reason for this is because the summary stats would often take quite a while to compute — if you wish to preserve the old behaviour you can stick to MCMCChains@6.\nJuliaBUGS @model\nJuliaBUGS.jl recently implemented a @model macro which, in terms of its syntax, looks somewhat similar to Turing.jl’s own macro, but under the hood constructs a BUGS model. Perhaps of interest is the way that parameters are initialised using @parameters struct ... end; this currently helps to initialise all parameter values to placeholders, and offers an alternative to explicitly specifying this with NamedTuples or arrays. This hasn’t yet been released but for more information and a demonstration, there’s a documentation page that describes the design of this macro. The existing @bugs macro will still be retained.\nLibtask\nLibtask.jl, the library that Turing’s particle Gibbs sampler is built on, was recently rewritten for its core parts by Will Tebbutt (#179. Libtask implements copyable, resumable tasks (coroutines) in pure Julia, and the new version is much faster and better documented. The new implementation is based on source code transformations, using tools and techniques from Mooncake.jl. Work is ongoing to adapt AdvancedPS.jl to work with the new Libtask version, and once that is done we should expect a performance boost for Turing’s particle Gibbs sampler. We’ll let you know once that’s out.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

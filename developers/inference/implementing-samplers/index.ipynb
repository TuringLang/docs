      "source": "In this tutorial, we'll go through step-by-step how to implement a \"simple\" sampler in [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl) in such a way that it can be easily applied to Turing.jl models.\n\nIn particular, we're going to implement a version of **Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA)**.\n\nNote that we will implement this sampler in the [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl) framework, completely \"ignoring\" Turing.jl until the very end of the tutorial, at which point we'll use a single line of code to make the resulting sampler available to Turing.jl. This is to really drive home the point that one can implement samplers in a way that is accessible to all of Turing.jl's users without having to use Turing.jl yourself.\n\n\n## Quick overview of MALA\n\nWe can view MALA as a single step of the leapfrog integrator with resampling of momentum $p$ at every step.[^2] To make that statement a bit more concrete, we first define the *extended* target $\\bar{\\gamma}(x, p)$ as\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\log \\bar{\\gamma}(x, p) \\propto \\log \\gamma(x) + \\log \\gamma_{\\mathcal{N}(0, M)}(p)\n\\end{equation*}\n\nwhere $\\gamma_{\\mathcal{N}(0, M)}$ denotes the density for a zero-centred Gaussian with covariance matrix $M$.\nWe then consider targeting this joint distribution over both $x$ and $p$ as follows.\nFirst we define the map\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n  L_{\\epsilon}: \\quad & \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d \\\\\n  & (x, p) \\mapsto (\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p}) := L_{\\epsilon}(x, p)\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nas\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n  p_{1 / 2} &:= p + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\nabla \\log \\gamma(x) \\\\\n  \\tilde{x} &:= x + \\epsilon M^{-1} p_{1 /2 } \\\\\n  p_1 &:= p_{1 / 2} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\nabla \\log \\gamma(\\tilde{x}) \\\\\n  \\tilde{p} &:= - p_1\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThis might be familiar for some readers as a single step of the Leapfrog integrator.\nWe then define the MALA kernel as follows: given the current iterate $x_i$, we sample the next iterate $x_{i + 1}$ as\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n  p &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, M) \\\\\n  (\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p}) &:= L_{\\epsilon}(x_i, p) \\\\\n  \\alpha &:= \\min \\left\\{ 1, \\frac{\\bar{\\gamma}(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p})}{\\bar{\\gamma}(x_i, p)} \\right\\} \\\\\n  x_{i + 1} &:=\n  \\begin{cases}\n    \\tilde{x} \\quad & \\text{ with prob. } \\alpha \\\\\n    x_i       \\quad & \\text{ with prob. } 1 - \\alpha\n  \\end{cases}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\n\ni.e. we accept the proposal $\\tilde{x}$ with probability $\\alpha$ and reject it, thus sticking with our current iterate, with probability $1 - \\alpha$.\n\n## What we need from a model: [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl)\n\nThere are a few things we need from the \"target\" / \"model\" / density that we want to sample from:\n\n1.  We need access to log-density *evaluations* $\\log \\gamma(x)$ so we can compute the acceptance ratio involving $\\log \\bar{\\gamma}(x, p)$.\n2.  We need access to log-density *gradients* $\\nabla \\log \\gamma(x)$ so we can compute the Leapfrog steps $L_{\\epsilon}(x, p)$.\n3.  We also need access to the \"size\" of the model so we can determine the size of $M$.\n\nLuckily for us, there is a package called [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) which provides an interface for *exactly* this!\n\nTo demonstrate how one can implement the \"[LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface\"[^1] we will use a simple Gaussian model as an example:",

Effectively, when working with inference methods that only require log-density evaluations and / or higher-order information of the log-density, Turing.jl actually converts the user-provided `Model` into an object implementing the above methods for [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl). As a result, most samplers provided by Turing.jl are actually implemented to work with [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl), enabling their use both *within* Turing.jl and *outside* of Turing.jl! Moreover, there exists similar conversions for Stan through BridgeStan and Stan[LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl), which means that a sampler supporting the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface can easily be used on both Turing.jl *and* Stan models (in addition to user-provided models, as our `IsotropicNormalModel` above)!\n\n\n## Implementing MALA in [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl)\n\nNow that we've established that a model implementing the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface provides us with all the information we need from $\\log \\gamma(x)$, we can address the question: given an object that implements the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface, how can we define a sampler for it?\n\nWe're going to do this by making our sampler a sub-type of `AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler` in addition to implementing a few methods from [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl). Why? Because it gets us *a lot* of functionality for free, as we will see later.\n\nMoreover, [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl) provides a very natural interface for MCMC algorithms.\n\nFirst, we'll define our `MALA` type",

But information which can change between iterations *should not go in the sampler itself*! Instead, this information should go in the sampler *state*.\n\nThe sampler state should at the very least contain all the necessary information to perform the next MCMC iteration, but usually contains further information, e.g. quantities and statistics useful for evaluating whether the sampler has converged.\n\nWe will use the following sampler state for our `MALA` sampler:",

A sample `MALASample` for our sampler `MALA`.\n\nThat means that we're ready to implement the only thing that really matters: `AbstractMCMC.step`.\n\n`AbstractMCMC.step` defines the MCMC iteration of our `MALA` given the current `MALAState`. Specifically, the signature of the function is as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    # The RNG to ensure reproducibility.\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    # The model that defines our target.\n    model::AbstractMCMC.AbstractModel,\n    # The sampler for which we're taking a `step`.\n    sampler::AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler,\n    # The current sampler `state`.\n    state;\n    # Additional keyword arguments that we may or may not need.\n    kwargs...\n)\n```\n\nMoreover, there is a specific `AbstractMCMC.AbstractModel` which is used to indicate that the model that is provided implements the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface: `AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel`.\n\nSince, as we discussed earlier, in our case we're indeed going to work with types that support the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface, we'll define `AbstractMCMC.step` for such a `AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel`.\n\nNote that `AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel` has no other purpose; it has a single field called `logdensity`, and it does nothing else. But by wrapping the model in `AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel`, it allows samplers that want to work with [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) to define their `AbstractMCMC.step` on this type without running into method ambiguities.\n\nAll in all, that means that the signature for our `AbstractMCMC.step` is going to be the following:\n\n```julia\nfunction AbstractMCMC.step(\n    rng::Random.AbstractRNG,\n    # `LogDensityModel` so we know we're working with LogDensityProblems.jl model.\n    model::AbstractMCMC.LogDensityModel,\n    # Our sampler.\n    sampler::MALA,\n    # Our sampler state.\n    state::MALAState;\n    kwargs...\n)\n```\n\nGreat!

Compute the log-density of the extended target $\\log \\bar{\\gamma}(x, p)$.\n3.  Take a single leapfrog step $(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{p}) = L_{\\epsilon}(x, p)$.\n4.

We define our models in the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface because it makes the sampler agnostic to how the underlying model is implemented.\n2.  We implement our sampler in the [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl) interface, which just means that our sampler is a subtype of `AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler` and we implement the MCMC transition in `AbstractMCMC.step`.\n3.  Points 1 and 2 makes it so our sampler can be used with a wide range of model implementations, amongst them being models implemented in both Turing.jl and Stan. This gives you, the inference implementer, a large collection of models to test your inference method on, in addition to allowing users of Turing.jl and Stan to try out your inference method with minimal effort.\n\n[^1]: There is no such thing as a proper interface in Julia (at least not officially), and so we use the word \"interface\" here to mean a few minimal methods that needs to be implemented by any type that we treat as a target model.\n\n[^2]: We're going with the leapfrog formulation because in a future version of this tutorial we'll add a section extending this simple \"baseline\" MALA sampler to more complex versions. See [issue #479](https://github.com/TuringLang/docs/issues/479) for progress on this.",

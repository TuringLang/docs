        "\n",
        "Submodels in DynamicPPL come with the notion of _prefixing_ variables: under the hood, this is implemented by adding a `PrefixContext` to the context stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "`PrefixContext` is a context that, as the name suggests, prefixes all variables inside a model with a given symbol.\n",
        "Thus, for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "using DynamicPPL, Distributions\n",
        "\n",
        "@model function f()\n",
        "    x ~ Normal()\n",

        "@model function g()\n",
        "    return a ~ to_submodel(f())\n",
        "end\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "inside the submodel `f`, the variables `x` and `y` become `a.x` and `a.y` respectively.\n",
        "This is easiest to observe by running the model:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{julia}\n",

        "keys(vi)\n",

        "::: {.callout-note}\n",
        "In this case, where `to_submodel` is called without any other arguments, the prefix to be used is automatically inferred from the name of the variable on the left-hand side of the tilde.\n",

        ":::\n",
        "\n",
        "The phrase 'becoming' a different variable is a little underspecified: it is useful to pinpoint the exact location where the prefixing occurs, which is `tilde_assume`.\n",
        "The method responsible for it is `tilde_assume(::PrefixContext, right, vn, vi)`: this attaches the prefix in the context to the `VarName` argument, before recursively calling `tilde_assume` with the new prefixed `VarName`.\n",
        "This means that even though a statement `x ~ dist` still enters the tilde pipeline at the top level as `x`, if the model evaluation context contains a `PrefixContext`, any function after `tilde_assume(::PrefixContext, ...)` will see `a.x` instead.\n",

        "`ConditionContext` is a context which stores values of variables that are to be conditioned on.\n",
        "These values may be stored as a `Dict` which maps `VarName`s to values, or alternatively as a `NamedTuple`.\n",
        "The latter only works correctly if all `VarName`s are 'basic', in that they have an identity optic (i.e., something like `a.x` or `a[1]` is forbidden).\n",
        "Because of this limitation, we will only use `Dict` in this example.\n",

        "::: {.callout-note}\n",
        "If a `ConditionContext` with a `NamedTuple` encounters anything to do with a prefix, its internal `NamedTuple` is converted to a `Dict` anyway, so it is quite reasonable to ignore the `NamedTuple` case in this exposition.\n",

        "(1) `hasconditioned_nested` and `getconditioned_nested` accomplish this by first 'collapsing' the context stack, i.e. they go through the context stack, remove all `PrefixContext`s, and apply those prefixes to any conditioned variables below it in the stack.\n",
        "Once the `PrefixContext`s have been removed, one can then iterate through the context stack and check if any of the `ConditionContext`s contain the variable, or get the value itself.\n",

        "Thus, as long as prefixing is implemented by applying a `PrefixContext` on the outermost layer of the _inner_ model context, this will be correctly combined with an external context to give the behaviour seen above.\n",

        "However, this is not actually the case: `contextual_isassumption`, which is the function that calls `hasconditioned_nested`, is much higher in the call stack than `tilde_assume` is.\n",
        "So, we need to explicitly prefix it before passing it to `contextual_isassumption`.\n",

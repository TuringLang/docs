        "\n",
        "At this point, one might wonder how we're going to tie this back to Turing.jl in the end. Effectively, when working with inference methods that only require log-density evaluations and / or higher-order information of the log-density, Turing.jl actually converts the user-provided `Model` into an object implementing the above methods for [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl). As a result, most samplers provided by Turing.jl are actually implemented to work with [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl), enabling their use both *within* Turing.jl and *outside* of Turing.jl! Morever, there exists similar conversions for Stan through BridgeStan and Stan[LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl), which means that a sampler supporting the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface can easily be used on both Turing.jl *and* Stan models (in addition to user-provided models, as our `IsotropicNormalModel` above)!\n",

        "## Implementing MALA in [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl)\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we've established that a model implementing the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface provides us with all the information we need from $\\log \\gamma(x)$, we can address the question: given an object that implements the [LogDensityProblems.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/LogDensityProblems.jl) interface, how can we define a sampler for it?\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to do this by making our sampler a sub-type of `AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler` in addition to implementing a few methods from [AbstractMCMC.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl). Why? Because it gets us *a lot* of functionality for free, as we will see later.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Notice how we've added the suffix `_init` to both the stepsize and the covariance matrix. We've done this because a `AbstractMCMC.AbstractSampler` should be *immutable*. Of course there might be many scenarios where we want to allow something like the stepsize and / or the covariance matrix to vary between iterations, e.g. during the burn-in / adaptation phase of the sampling process we might want to adjust the parameters using statistics computed from these initial iterations. But information which can change between iterations *should not go in the sampler itself*! Instead, this information should go in the sampler *state*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sampler state should at the very least contain all the necessary information to perform the next MCMC iteration, but usually contains further information, e.g. quantities and statistics useful for evaluating whether the sampler has converged.\n",

        "In this particular case we indeed could have dropped this and simply used a `AbstractVector{<:Real}` as our sampler state, but typically, as we will see later, one wants to include other quantities in the sampler state.\n",
        "For example, if we also wanted to adapt the parameters of our `MALA`, e.g. alter the stepsize depending on acceptance rates, in which case we should also put `ϵ` in the state, but for now we'll keep things simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, we also want a _sample_ type, which is a type meant for \"public consumption\", i.e. the end-user. This is generally going to contain a subset of the information present in the state. But in such a simple scenario as this, we similarly only have a `AbstractVector{<:Real}`:\n",

        "3.  Points 1 and 2 makes it so our sampler can be used with a wide range of model implementations, amongst them being models implemented in both Turing.jl and Stan. This gives you, the inference implementer, a large collection of models to test your inference method on, in addition to allowing users of Turing.jl and Stan to try out your inference method with minimal effort.\n",

        "[^2]: We're going with the leapfrog formulation because in a future version of this tutorial we'll add a section extending this simple \"baseline\" MALA sampler to more complex versions. See [issue #479](https://github.com/TuringLang/docs/issues/479) for progress on this."

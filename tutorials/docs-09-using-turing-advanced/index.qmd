# Advanced Usage

## How to Define a Customized Distribution

`Turing.jl` supports the use of distributions from the Distributions.jl package. By extension, it also supports the use of customized distributions by defining them as subtypes of `Distribution` type of the Distributions.jl package, as well as corresponding functions.

Below shows a workflow of how to define a customized distribution, using our own implementation of a simple `Uniform` distribution as a simple example.

### 1. Define the Distribution Type

First, define a type of the distribution, as a subtype of a corresponding distribution type in the Distributions.jl package.

```{julia; eval=true}
struct CustomUniform <: ContinuousUnivariateDistribution end
```

### 2. Implement Sampling and Evaluation of the log-pdf

Second, define `rand` and `logpdf`, which will be used to run the model.

```{julia; eval=true}
# sample in [0, 1]
Distributions.rand(rng::AbstractRNG, d::CustomUniform) = rand(rng)

# p(x) = 1 → logp(x) = 0
Distributions.logpdf(d::CustomUniform, x::Real) = zero(x)
```

### 3. Define Helper Functions

In most cases, it may be required to define some helper functions.

#### 3.1 Domain Transformation

Certain samplers, such as `HMC`, require the domain of the priors to be unbounded. Therefore, to use our `CustomUniform` as a prior in a model we also need to define how to transform samples from `[0, 1]` to `ℝ`. To do this, we simply need to define the corresponding `Bijector` from `Bijectors.jl`, which is what `Turing.jl` uses internally to deal with constrained distributions.

To transform from `[0, 1]` to `ℝ` we can use the `Logit` bijector:

```{julia; eval=true}
Bijectors.bijector(d::CustomUniform) = Logit(0.0, 1.0)
```

You'd do the exact same thing for `ContinuousMultivariateDistribution` and `ContinuousMatrixDistribution`. For example, `Wishart` defines a distribution over positive-definite matrices and so `bijector` returns a `PDBijector` when called with a `Wishart` distribution as an argument. For discrete distributions, there is no need to define a bijector; the `Identity` bijector is used by default.

Alternatively, for `UnivariateDistribution` we can define the `minimum` and `maximum` of the distribution

```{julia; eval=true}
Distributions.minimum(d::CustomUniform) = 0.0
Distributions.maximum(d::CustomUniform) = 1.0
```

and `Bijectors.jl` will return a default `Bijector` called `TruncatedBijector` which makes use of `minimum` and `maximum` derive the correct transformation.

Internally, Turing basically does the following when it needs to convert a constrained distribution to an unconstrained distribution, e.g. when sampling using `HMC`:

```{julia; eval=true}
dist = Gamma(2,3)
b = bijector(dist)
transformed_dist = transformed(dist, b) # results in distribution with transformed support + correction for logpdf
```

and then we can call `rand` and `logpdf` as usual, where

  - `rand(transformed_dist)` returns a sample in the unconstrained space, and
  - `logpdf(transformed_dist, y)` returns the log density of the original distribution, but with `y` living in the unconstrained space.

## Update the accumulated log probability in the model definition

Turing accumulates log probabilities internally in an internal data structure that is accessible through
the internal variable `__varinfo__` inside of the model definition (see below for more details about model internals).
However, since users should not have to deal with internal data structures, a macro `Turing.@addlogprob!` is provided
that increases the accumulated log probability. For instance, this allows you to
[include arbitrary terms in the likelihood](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/issues/1332)

```julia
using Turing

myloglikelihood(x, μ) = loglikelihood(Normal(μ, 1), x)

@model function demo(x)
    μ ~ Normal()
    Turing.@addlogprob! myloglikelihood(x, μ)
end
```

and to [reject samples](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/issues/1328):

```julia
using Turing
using LinearAlgebra

@model function demo(x)
    m ~ MvNormal(zero(x), I)
    if dot(m, x) < 0
        Turing.@addlogprob! -Inf
        # Exit the model evaluation early
        return nothing
    end

    x ~ MvNormal(m, I)
    return nothing
end
```

Note that `@addlogprob!` always increases the accumulated log probability, regardless of the provided
sampling context. For instance, if you do not want to apply `Turing.@addlogprob!` when evaluating the
prior of your model but only when computing the log likelihood and the log joint probability, then you
should [check the type of the internal variable `__context_`](https://github.com/TuringLang/DynamicPPL.jl/issues/154)
such as

```{julia; eval=false}
if DynamicPPL.leafcontext(__context__) !== Turing.PriorContext()
    Turing.@addlogprob! myloglikelihood(x, μ)
end
```

## Model Internals

The `@model` macro accepts a function definition and rewrites it such that call of the function generates a `Model` struct for use by the sampler.
Models can be constructed by hand without the use of a macro.
Taking the `gdemo` model as an example, the macro-based definition

```julia
using Turing

@model function gdemo(x)
    # Set priors.
    s² ~ InverseGamma(2, 3)
    m ~ Normal(0, sqrt(s²))

    # Observe each value of x.
    @. x ~ Normal(m, sqrt(s²))
end

model = gdemo([1.5, 2.0])
```

can be implemented also (a bit less generally) with the macro-free version

```julia
using Turing

# Create the model function.
function gdemo(model, varinfo, context, x)
    # Assume s² has an InverseGamma distribution.
    s², varinfo = DynamicPPL.tilde_assume!!(
        context, InverseGamma(2, 3), Turing.@varname(s²), varinfo
    )

    # Assume m has a Normal distribution.
    m, varinfo = DynamicPPL.tilde_assume!!(
        context, Normal(0, sqrt(s²)), Turing.@varname(m), varinfo
    )

    # Observe each value of x[i] according to a Normal distribution.
    return DynamicPPL.dot_tilde_observe!!(
        context, Normal(m, sqrt(s²)), x, Turing.@varname(x), varinfo
    )
end
gdemo(x) = Turing.Model(gdemo, (; x))

# Instantiate a Model object with our data variables.
model = gdemo([1.5, 2.0])
```

## Task Copying

Turing [copies](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/4085) Julia tasks to
deliver efficient inference algorithms, but it also provides alternative slower
implementation as a fallback. Task copying is enabled by default. Task copying
requires us to use the `TapedTask` facility which is provided by
[Libtask](https://github.com/TuringLang/Libtask.jl) to create tasks.

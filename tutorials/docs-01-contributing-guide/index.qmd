Turing is an open-source project. If you feel that you have relevant skills and are interested in contributing, please do get in touch. You can contribute by opening issues on GitHub, implementing things yourself, and making a pull request. We would also appreciate example models written using Turing.

Turing has a [style guide]({{< meta site-url >}}docs/tutorials/docs-02-contributing-style-guide/). Reviewing it before making a pull request is not strictly necessary, but you may be asked to change portions of your code to conform with the style guide before it is merged.

### What Can I Do?

Look at the [issues](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/issues) page for an outstanding issue. For instance, you could implement new features, fix bugs or write example models.

### Git Workflow

For more information on how the Git workflow typically functions, please see the [GitHub's introduction](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or [Julia's contribution guide](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

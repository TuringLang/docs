        "\n",
        "For the purposes of this tutorial, we choose priors for the parameters that are quite close to the ground truth.\n",
        "As justification, we can imagine we have preexisting estimates for the biological rates.\n",
        "Practically, this helps us to illustrate the results without needing to run overly long MCMC chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note we also have to take special care with the ODE solver.\n",
        "For certain parameter combinations, the numerical solver may predict animal densities that are just barely below zero.\n",
        "This causes errors with the Poisson distribution, which needs a non-negative mean $\\lambda$.\n",
        "To avoid this happening, we tell the solver to aim for small absolute and relative errors (`abstol=1e-6, reltol=1e-6`).\n",
        "We also add a fudge factor `ϵ = 1e-5` to the predicted data.\n",
        "Since `ϵ` is greater than the solver's tolerance, it should overcome any remaining numerical error, making sure all predicted values are positive.\n",
        "At the same time, it is so small compared to the data that it should have a negligible effect on inference.\n",
        "If this approach doesn't work, there are some more ideas to try [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/faq/#My-ODE-goes-negative-but-should-stay-positive,-what-tools-can-help?).\n",
        "In the case of continuous observations (e.g. data derived from modelling chemical reactions), it is sufficient to use a normal distribution with the mean as the data point and an appropriately chosen variance (which can itself also be a parameter with a prior distribution).\n",

        "DifferentialEquations.jl's efficiency for large stiff models has been shown in [multiple benchmarks](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqBenchmarks.jl).\n",
        "To learn more about how to optimize solving performance for stiff problems you can take a look at the [docs](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/tutorials/advanced_ode_example/).\n",
        "\n",
        "_Sensitivity analysis_ is provided by the [SciMLSensitivity.jl package](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLSensitivity/stable/), which forms part of SciML's differential equation suite.\n",
        "The model sensitivities are the derivatives of the solution with respect to the parameters.\n",
        "Specifically, the local sensitivity of the solution to a parameter is defined by how much the solution would change if the parameter were changed by a small amount.\n",
        "Sensitivity analysis provides a cheap way to calculate the gradient of the solution which can be used in parameter estimation and other optimization tasks.\n",
        "The sensitivity analysis methods in SciMLSensitivity.jl are based on automatic differentiation (AD), and are compatible with many of Julia's AD backends.\n",
        "More details on the mathematical theory that underpins these methods can be found in [the SciMLSensitivity documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLSensitivity/stable/sensitivity_math/).\n",
        "\n",
        "To enable sensitivity analysis, you will need to `import SciMLSensitivity`, and also use one of the AD backends that is compatible with SciMLSensitivity.jl when sampling.\n",
        "For example, if we wanted to use [Mooncake.jl](https://chalk-lab.github.io/Mooncake.jl/stable/), we could run:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{julia}\n",
        "import Mooncake\n",
        "import SciMLSensitivity\n",
        "\n",
        "# Define the AD backend to use\n",
        "adtype = AutoMooncake()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Sample a single chain with 1000 samples using Mooncake\n",
        "sample(model, NUTS(; adtype=adtype), 1000; progress=false)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, SciMLSensitivity will automatically choose an appropriate sensitivity analysis algorithm for you.\n",
        "You can also manually specify an algorithm by providing the `sensealg` keyword argument to the `solve` function; the existing algorithms are covered in [this page of the SciMLSensitivity docs](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLSensitivity/stable/manual/differential_equation_sensitivities/).\n",

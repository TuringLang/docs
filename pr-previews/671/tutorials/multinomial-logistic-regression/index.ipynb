Then we create the intercepts and vectors of coefficients for the other classes against that baseline. More concretely, we create scalar intercepts `intercept_versicolor` and `intersept_virginica` and coefficient vectors `coefficients_versicolor` and `coefficients_virginica` with four coefficients each for the features `SepalLength`, `SepalWidth`, `PetalLength` and `PetalWidth`. We assume a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation `σ` as prior for each scalar parameter.

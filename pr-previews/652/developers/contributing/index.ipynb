      "source": "Turing is an open-source project and is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/TuringLang).\nWe welcome contributions from the community in all forms, large or small: bug reports, feature implementations, code contributions, or improvements to documentation or infrastructure are all extremely valuable.\nWe would also very much appreciate examples of models written using Turing.\n\n### How to get involved\n\nOur outstanding issues are tabulated on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/issues).\nClosing one of these may involve implementing new features, fixing bugs, or writing example models.\n\nYou can also join the `#turing` channel on the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) and say hello!\n\nIf you are new to open source software, please see [GitHub's introduction](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or [Julia's contribution guide](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on using version control for collaboration.\n\n### Documentation\n\nEach of the packages in the Turing ecosystem (see [Libraries](/library)) has its own documentation, which is typically found in the `docs` folder of the corresponding package.\nFor example, the source code for DynamicPPL's documentation can be found in [its repository](https://github.com/TuringLang/DynamicPPL.jl).\n\nThe documentation for Turing.jl itself consists of the tutorials that you see on this website, and is built from the separate [`docs` repository](https://github.com/TuringLang/docs).\nNone of the documentation is generated from the [main Turing.jl repository](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl); in particular, the API that Turing exports does not currently form part of the documentation.\n\nOther sections of the website (anything that isn't a package, or a tutorial) – for example, the list of libraries – is built from the [`turinglang.github.io` repository](https://github.com/TuringLang/turinglang.github.io).\n\n### Tests\n\nTuring, like most software libraries, has a test suite. You can run the whole suite by running `julia --project=.` from the root of the Turing repository, and then running\n\n```julia\nimport Pkg; Pkg.test(\"Turing\")\n```\n\nThe test suite subdivides into files in the `test` folder, and you can run only some of them using commands like\n\n```julia\nimport Pkg; Pkg.test(\"Turing\"; test_args=[\"optim\", \"hmc\", \"--skip\", \"ext\"])\n```\n\nThis one would run all files with \"optim\" or \"hmc\" in their path, such as `test/optimisation/Optimisation.jl`, but not files with \"ext\" in their path. Alternatively, you can set these arguments as command line arguments when you run Julia\n\n```julia\njulia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.test(; test_args=ARGS)' -- optim hmc --skip ext\n```\n\nAlternatively, set the global `ARGS` variable, and call `include(\"test/runtests.jl\")`. \n\n### Pull requests, versions, and releases\n\nWe merge all code changes through pull requests on GitHub.\nTo make a contribution to one of the Turing packages, fork it on GitHub, start a new branch on your fork, and add commits to it.\nOnce you're done, open a pull request to the main repository under [TuringLang](https://github.com/TuringLang).\nSomeone from the dev team will review your code (if they don't, ping `@TuringLang/maintainers` in a comment to get their attention) and check that the continuous integration tests pass (with some allowed exceptions, see below).\nIf all looks good, we'll merge your PR with gratitude.\nIf not, we'll help you fix it and then merge it with gratitude.\n\nEverything in this section about pull requests and branches applies to the Turing.jl and DynamicPPL.jl repositories.\nMost of it also applies to other repositories under the TuringLang ecosystem, though some do not bother with the `main`/`breaking` distinction or with a `HISTORY.md`.\nAs at August 2025 we are slowly moving towards having all repos do the full process, so a new `HISTORY.md` in a repo that doesn't yet have one is always welcome.\n\n#### Branches\n\nLike Julia packages generally, Turing.jl follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).\nBecause of this, we have two persistently alive branches in our repository: `main` and `breaking`.\nAll code that gets released as a new version of Turing gets merged into `main`, and a release is made from there.\nHowever, any breaking changes should first be merged into `breaking`.\n`breaking` will then periodically be merged into `main`.\n\nThe idea is that `breaking` always contains commits that build towards the next breaking release in the semantic versioning sense.\nThat is, if the changes you make might break or change the behaviour of correctly written code that uses Turing.jl, your PR should target the `breaking` branch, and your code should be merged into `breaking`.\nIf your changes cause no such breakage for users, your PR should target `main`.\nNotably, any bug fixes should merge directly into `main`.\n\nThis way we can frequently release new patch version from `main`, while developing breaking changes in parallel on `breaking`.\nE.g. if the current version is 0.19.3, and someone fixes a bug, we can merge the fix into `main` and release it as 0.19.4.\nMeanwhile, breaking changes can be developed and merged into `breaking`, which is building towards a release of 0.20.0.\nMultiple breaking changes may be accumulated into `breaking`, before finally the `breaking`-to-`main` merge is done, and 0.20.0 is released.\nOn `breaking` the version number should then immediately be bumped to 0.21.\n\nWe do not generally backport bug fixes, although we may consider doing so in special circumstances.\n\n#### Change history\n\nWe keep a cumulative changelog in a file called `HISTORY.md` at the root of the repository.\nIt should have an entry for every new breaking release, explaining everything our users need to know about the changes, such as what may have broken and how to fix things to work with the new version.\nAny major new features should also be described in `HISTORY.md`, as may any other changes that are useful for users to know about.\nBug fixes generally don't need an entry in `HISTORY.md`.\nAny new breaking release must have an entry in `HISTORY.md`, entries for non-breaking releases are optional.\n\n#### Continuous integration (CI) tests\n\nWe generally run the whole test suite of each repository in a GitHub action, typically for a few different versions of Julia, including the earliest supported version and the latest stable release.\nOn some repositories we also run a few other checks in CI, such as code formatting and simple benchmarks.\nGenerally all tests except those run on a prerelease version of Julia (e.g. a release candidate of an upcoming Julia release), and all code formatting checks, should pass before merging a PR.\nExceptions can be made if the cause of the failure is known and unrelated to the PR.\nCI checks other than tests and formatting serve various purposes, and some of them can be allowed to fail.\nSome examples are\n\n  - Anything running on a prerelease of Julia. These inform us of trouble ahead when that prerelease becomes an actual release, but don't require fixing for a PR to be merged.\n  - Any code coverage checks. Code coverage numbers can be helpful in catching missing tests or cases where the tests don't test what they are intended to. However, we do not insist on any particular coverage figures, since they are not a very good metric of a test suite's extensiveness.\n  - The benchmarks on DynamicPPL repo. These should be investigated to understand why they fail. If the reason is a bug in the PR, an actual test should be added to the test suite to catch it. However, sometimes they fail for unrelated reasons.\n  - Occasionally CI failures are caused by bugs that require upstream fixes (such as for AD backends, or base Julia). Please ping a maintainer if you are unsure if this is the case. A good indicator for this is if the same test is failing on the base branch of your pull request.\n  - The CI check in the `docs` repo for whether the docs are built with the latest Turing.jl release. This test failing is a reminder that we should make a PR to update to the latest version, but does not need fixing when working on a PR that makes unrelated changes to the documentation.\n\nIf you are ever unsure whether some CI check needs to pass, or if the reason why one is failing is mysterious or seems unrelated to the PR, ask a maintainer and they'll help you out.\n\n#### Please make mistakes\n\nGetting pull requests from outside the core developer team is one of the greatest joys of open source maintenance, and Turing's community of contributors is its greatest asset.\nIf you are thinking of contributing, please do open a pull request, even an imperfect or half-finished one, or an issue to discuss it first if you prefer.\nYou don't need to nail all of the above details on the first go, the dev team is very happy to help you figure out how to bump version numbers or whether you need to target `main` or `breaking`.\n\n#### For Turing.jl core developers\n\nIf you are a core developer of TuringLang, two notes, in addition to the above, apply:\n\n1. You don't need to make your own fork of the package you are editing.\nJust make a new branch on the main repository, usually named `your-username/change-you-are-making` (we don't strictly enforce this convention though).\nYou should definitely still make a branch and a PR, and never push directly to `main` or `breaking`.\n2. You can make a release of the package after your work is merged into `main`.\nThis is done by leaving a comment on the latest commit on `main`, saying\n\n```\n@JuliaRegistrator register\n\nRelease notes:\n[YOUR RELEASE NOTES HERE]\n```\n\nIf you are making a breaking release, your release notes must also contain the string `Breaking changes` somewhere in them (this is mandated by the `@JuliaRegistrator` bot, described below).\n\nThe `@JuliaRegistrator` bot will handle creating a pull request into the Julia central package repository and tagging a new release in the repository.\nThe release notes should be a copy-paste of the notes written in `HISTORY.md` if such an entry exists, or otherwise (for a patch release) a short summary of changes.\n\nEven core devs should always merge all their code through pull requests into `main` or `breaking`.\nAll code should generally be reviewed by another core developer and pass continuous integration (CI) checks.\nExceptions can be made in some cases though, such as ignoring failing CI checks where the cause is known and not due to the current pull request, or skipping code review when the pull request author is an experienced developer of the package and the changes are trivial.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nTuring uses [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl) to ensure consistent code style across the codebase.\n**All code must be formatted before submitting a pull request**, and ideally with every commit.\n\n#### Installing JuliaFormatter\n\nWe use version 1 of JuliaFormatter.\nInstall it in your **global Julia environment** (not the project environment, as adding it to the `Project.toml` would make it an invalid dependency of the project):\n\n```julia\njulia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(name=\"JuliaFormatter\", version=\"1\"); Pkg.pin(\"JuliaFormatter\")'\n```\n\n#### Formatting Code\n\nTo format all Julia files in the current directory and subdirectories:\n\n```julia\njulia -e 'using JuliaFormatter; format(\".\")'\n```\n\nRun this command from the root of the repository before committing your changes.\nThis ensures your code follows the project's formatting standards and maintains consistency across the codebase.\n\n### Style Guide\n\nTuring has a style guide, described below.\nReviewing it before making a pull request is not strictly necessary, but you may be asked to change portions of your code to conform with the style guide before it is merged.\n\nMost Turing code follows [Blue: a Style Guide for Julia](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/BlueStyle).\nThese conventions were created from a variety of sources including Python's [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), Julia's [Notes for Contributors](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and Julia's [Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/).\n\n#### Synopsis\n\n  - Use 4 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.\n  - Try to adhere to a 92 character line length limit.\n  - Use upper camel case convention for [modules](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/) and [types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/).\n  - Use lower case with underscores for method names (note: Julia code likes to use lower case without underscores).\n  - Comments are good, try to explain the intentions of the code.\n  - Use whitespace to make the code more readable.\n  - No whitespace at the end of a line (trailing whitespace).\n  - Avoid padding brackets with spaces. ex. `Int64(value)` preferred over `Int64( value )`.\n\n#### A Word on Consistency\n\nWhen adhering to the Blue style, it's important to realise that these are guidelines, not rules. This is [stated best in the PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds):\n\n> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is most important.\n\n> But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent – sometimes the style guide just doesn't apply. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!"

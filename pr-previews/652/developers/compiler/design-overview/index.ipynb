        "In this section, the current design of Turing's model \"compiler\" is described which enables Turing to perform various types of Bayesian inference without changing the model definition. The \"compiler\" is essentially just a macro that rewrites the user's model definition to a function that generates a `Model` struct that Julia's dispatch can operate on and that Julia's compiler can successfully do type inference on for efficient machine code generation.\n",

        "The following terminology will be used in this section:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `D`: observed data variables conditioned upon in the posterior,\n",
        "  - `P`: parameter variables distributed according to the prior distributions, these will also be referred to as random variables,\n",
        "  - `Model`: a fully defined probabilistic model with input data\n",
        "\n",
        "`Turing`'s `@model` macro rewrites the user-provided function definition such that it can be used to instantiate a `Model` by passing in the observed data `D`.\n",

        "The following are the main jobs of the `@model` macro:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Parse `~` and `.~` lines, e.g. `y .~ Normal.(c*x, 1.0)`\n",
        " 2. Figure out if a variable belongs to the data `D` and or to the parameters `P`\n",
        " 3. Enable the handling of missing data variables in `D` when defining a `Model` and treating them as parameter variables in `P` instead\n",
        " 4. Enable the tracking of random variables using the data structures `VarName` and `VarInfo`\n",
        " 5. Change `~`/`.~` lines with a variable in `P` on the LHS to a call to `tilde_assume` or `dot_tilde_assume`\n",

Random variables whose distributions have a constrained support are transformed using a bijector from [Bijectors.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl) so that the sampling happens in the unconstrained space.

        "Note that in order to make `md::Metadata` type stable, all the `md.vns` must have the same symbol and distribution type. However, one can have a single Julia variable, e.g. `x`, that is a matrix or a hierarchical array sampled in partitions, e.g. `x[1][:] ~ MvNormal(zeros(2), I); x[2][:] ~ MvNormal(ones(2), I)`. The symbol `x` can still be managed by a single `md::Metadata` without hurting the type stability since all the distributions on the RHS of `~` are of the same type.\n",

        "However, in `Turing` models one cannot have this restriction, so we must use a type unstable `Metadata` if we want to use one `Metadata` instance for the whole model. This is what `UntypedVarInfo` does. A type unstable `Metadata` will still work but will have inferior performance.\n",

        "To strike a balance between flexibility and performance when constructing the `spl::Sampler` instance, the model is first run by sampling the parameters in `P` from their priors using an `UntypedVarInfo`, i.e. a type unstable `Metadata` is used for all the variables. Then once all the symbols and distribution types have been identified, a `vi::TypedVarInfo` is constructed where `vi.metadata` is a `NamedTuple` mapping each symbol in `P` to a specialized instance of `Metadata`. So as long as each symbol in `P` is sampled from only one type of distributions, `vi::TypedVarInfo` will have fully concretely typed fields which brings out the peak performance of Julia."

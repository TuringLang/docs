      "source": "## Choose your AD backend\n\nAutomatic differentiation (AD) makes it possible to use modern, efficient gradient-based samplers like NUTS and HMC.\nThis, however, also means that using a performant AD system is incredibly important.\nTuring currently supports several AD backends, including [ForwardDiff](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) (the default), [Mooncake](https://github.com/chalk-lab/Mooncake.jl), and [ReverseDiff](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl).\n\nFor many common types of models, the default ForwardDiff backend performs well, and there is no need to worry about changing it.\nHowever, if you need more speed, you can try different backends via the standard [ADTypes](https://github.com/SciML/ADTypes.jl) interface by passing an `AbstractADType` to the sampler with the optional `adtype` argument, e.g. `NUTS(; adtype = AutoMooncake())`.\n\nGenerally, `adtype = AutoForwardDiff()` is likely to be the fastest and most reliable for models with few parameters (say, less than 20 or so), while reverse-mode backends such as `AutoMooncake()` or `AutoReverseDiff()` will perform better for models with many parameters or linear algebra operations.\nIf in doubt, you can benchmark your model with different backends to see which one performs best.\nSee the [Automatic Differentiation]({{<meta usage-automatic-differentiation>}}) page for details.\n\n### Special care for ReverseDiff with a compiled tape\n\nFor large models, the fastest option is often ReverseDiff with a compiled tape, specified as `adtype=AutoReverseDiff(; compile=true)`.\nHowever, it is important to note that if your model contains any branching code, such as `if`-`else` statements, **the gradients from a compiled tape may be inaccurate, leading to erroneous results**.\nIf you use this option for the (considerable) speedup it can provide, make sure to check your code for branching and ensure that it does not affect the gradients.\nIt is also a good idea to verify your gradients with another backend.\n\n## Ensure that types in your model can be inferred\n\nFor efficient gradient-based inference, e.g. using HMC, NUTS or ADVI, it is important to ensure the types in your model can be inferred.\n\nThe following example with abstract types"

In order to do so:\n\n  - (2a) We need to make sure that when evaluating a submodel, the context stack is arranged such that `PrefixContext` is applied _inside_ the parent model's context, but _outside_ the submodel's own context.\n\n  - (2b) We also need to make sure that the `VarName` passed to it is prefixed correctly.\n\n## How do we do it?\n\n(1) `hasconditioned_nested` and `getconditioned_nested` accomplish this by first 'collapsing' the context stack, i.e. they go through the context stack, remove all `PrefixContext`s, and apply those prefixes to any conditioned variables below it in the stack.\nOnce the `PrefixContext`s have been removed, one can then iterate through the context stack and check if any of the `ConditionContext`s contain the variable, or get the value itself.\nFor more details the reader is encouraged to read the source code.\n\n(2a) We ensure that the context stack is correctly arranged by relying on the behaviour of `make_evaluate_args_and_kwargs`.\nThis function is called whenever a model (which itself contains a context) is evaluated with a separate ('external') context, and makes sure to arrange both of these contexts such that _the model's context is nested inside the external context_.\nThus, as long as prefixing is implemented by applying a `PrefixContext` on the outermost layer of the _inner_ model context, this will be correctly combined with an external context to give the behaviour seen above.\n\n(2b) At first glance, it seems like `tilde_assume` can take care of the `VarName` prefixing for us (as described in the first section).\nHowever, this is not actually the case: `contextual_isassumption`, which is the function that calls `hasconditioned_nested`, is much higher in the call stack than `tilde_assume` is.\nSo, we need to explicitly prefix it before passing it to `contextual_isassumption`.\nThis is done inside the `@model` macro, or technically, its subsidiary function `isassumption`.\n\n## Nested submodels\n\nJust in case the above wasn't complicated enough, we need to also be very careful when dealing with nested submodels, which have multiple layers of `PrefixContext`s which may be interspersed with `ConditionContext`s.\nFor example, in this series of nested submodels,",

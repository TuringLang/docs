```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
using Pkg;
Pkg.instantiate();
```

If you are already well-versed in probabilistic programming and want to take a quick look at how Turing's syntax works or otherwise just want a model to start with, we have provided a complete Bayesian coin-flipping model below.

This example can be run wherever you have Julia installed (see [Getting Started](../docs-00-getting-started/index.qmd), but you will need to install the packages `Turing` and `StatsPlots` if you have not done so already.

This is an excerpt from a more formal example which can be found [here](../00-introduction/index.qmd).

## Import Libraries
```{julia}
# Import libraries.
using Turing, StatsPlots, Random
```

```{julia}
# Set the true probability of heads in a coin.
p_true = 0.5

# Iterate from having seen 0 observations to 100 observations.
Ns = 0:100
```

```{julia}
# Draw data from a Bernoulli distribution, i.e. draw heads or tails.
Random.seed!(12)
data = rand(Bernoulli(p_true), last(Ns))
```


## Declare Turing Model
```{julia}
# Declare our Turing model.
@model function coinflip(y)
    # Our prior belief about the probability of heads in a coin.
    p ~ Beta(1, 1)

    # The number of observations.
    N = length(y)
    for n in 1:N
        # Heads or tails of a coin are drawn from a Bernoulli distribution.
        y[n] ~ Bernoulli(p)
    end
end
```


## Setting HMC Sampler
```{julia}
# Settings of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.
iterations = 1000
ϵ = 0.05
τ = 10

# Start sampling.
chain = sample(coinflip(data), HMC(ϵ, τ), iterations, progress=false)
```


## Plot a summary
```{julia}
# Plot a summary of the sampling process for the parameter p, i.e. the probability of heads in a coin.
histogram(chain[:p])
```
